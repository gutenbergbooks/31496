Ditte's Family Tree</span></h2>


<p>It has always been considered a sign of good birth
to be able to count one's ancestors for centuries
back. In consequence of this, Ditte Child o' Man
stood at the top of the tree. She belonged to one of
the largest families in the country, the family of Man.</p>

<p>No genealogical chart exists, nor would it be easy
to work it out; its branches are as the sands of the
sea, and from it all other generations can be traced.
Here it cropped out as time went on&mdash;then twined
back when its strength was spent and its part played
out. The Man family is in a way as the mighty
ocean, from which the waves mount lightly towards the
skies, only to retreat in a sullen flow.</p>

<p>According to tradition, the first mother of the family
is said to have been a field worker who, by resting on
the cultivated ground, became pregnant and brought
forth a son. And it was this son who founded the
numerous and hardy family for whom all things prospered.
The most peculiar characteristic of the Man
family in him was that everything he touched became
full of life and throve.</p>

<p>This boy for a long time bore the marks of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
clinging earth, but he outgrew it and became an able
worker of the field; with him began the cultivation
of the land. That he had no father gave him much
food for thought, and became the great and everlasting
problem of his life. In his leisure he created a whole
religion out of it.</p>

<p>He could hold his own when it came to blows; in his
work there was no one to equal him, but his wife had
him well in hand. The name Man is said to have
originated in his having one day, when she had driven
him forth by her sharp tongue, sworn threateningly
that he was master in his own house, "master" being
equivalent to "man." Several of the male members of
this family have since found it hard to bow their pride
before their women folk.</p>

<p>A branch of the family settled down on the desert
coast up near the Cattegat, and this was the beginning
of the hamlet. It was in those times when forest and
swamp still made the country impassable, and the sea
was used as a highway. The reefs are still there on
which the men landed from the boats, carrying women
and children ashore; by day and by night white seagulls
take turns to mark the place&mdash;and have done so through
centuries.</p>

<p>This branch had in a marked degree the typical
characteristics of the family: two eyes&mdash;and a nose in
the middle of their faces; one mouth which could both
kiss and bite, and a pair of fists which they could make
good use of. In addition to this the family was alike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
in that most of its members were better than their
circumstances. One could recognize the Man family
anywhere by their bad qualities being traceable to
definite causes, while for the good in them there was
no explanation at all: it was inbred.</p>

<p>It was a desolate spot they had settled upon, but
they took it as it was, and gave themselves up patiently
to the struggle for existence, built huts, chopped wood
and made ditches. They were contented and hardy,
and had the Man's insatiable desire to overcome difficulties;
for them there was no bitterness in work, and
before long the result of their labors could be seen.
But keep the profit of their work they could not; they
allowed others to have the spending of it, and thus it
came about, that in spite of their industry they remained
as poor as ever.</p>

<p>Over a century ago, before the north part of the
coast was discovered by the land folk, the place still
consisted of a cluster of hunch-backed, mildewed huts,
which might well have been the originals, and on the
whole resembled a very ancient hamlet. The beach
was strewn with tools and drawn-up boats. The water
in the little bay stank of castaway fish, catfish and
others which, on account of their singular appearance,
were supposed to be possessed of devils, and therefore
not eaten.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour's walk from the hamlet, out
on the point, lived Sören Man. In his young days he
had roamed the seas like all the others, but according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
to custom had later on settled himself down as a fisherman.
Otherwise, he was really more of a peasant and
belonged to that branch of the family which had
devoted itself to the soil, and for this had won much
respect. Sören Man was the son of a farmer, but on
reaching man's estate, he married a fisher girl and
gave himself up to fishing together with agriculture&mdash;exactly
as the first peasant in the family had
done.</p>

<p>The land was poor, two or three acres of downs
where a few sheep struggled for their food, and this
was all that remained of a large farm which had once
been there, and where now seagulls flocked screaming
over the white surf. The rest had been devoured
by the ocean.</p>

<p>It was Sören's, and more particularly Maren's foolish
pride that his forefathers had owned a farm. It had
been there sure enough three or four generations back;
with a fairly good ground, a clay bank jutting out into
the sea. A strong four-winged house, built of oak&mdash;taken
from wrecks&mdash;could be seen from afar, a picture
of strength. But then suddenly the ocean began to
creep in. Three generations, one after the other, were
forced to shift the farm further back to prevent its
falling into the sea, and to make the moving easier, each
time a wing was left behind; there was, of course, no
necessity for so much house-room, when the land was
eaten by the sea. All that now remained was the
heavy-beamed old dwelling-house which had prudently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
been placed on the landward side of the road, and a
few sandhills.</p>

<p>Here the sea no longer encroached. Now the best
had gone, with the lands of Man, it was satiated and
took its costly food elsewhere; here, indeed, it gave
back again, throwing sand up on to the land, which
formed a broad beach in front of the slope, and on
windy days would drift, covering the rest of the field.
Under the thin straggling downs could still be traced
the remains of old plowland, broken off crudely on the
slope, and of old wheeltracks running outwards and
disappearing abruptly in the blue sky over the sea.</p>

<p>For many years, after stormy nights with the sea at
high tide, it had been the Man's invariable custom each
morning to find out how much had again been taken by
the sea; burrowing animals hastened the destruction;
and it happened that whole pieces of field with their
crops would suddenly go; down in the muttering ocean
it lay, and on it the mark of harrow and plow and the
green reflection of winter crops over it.</p>

<p>It told on a man to be witness of the inevitable. For
each time a piece of their land was taken by the sea with
all their toil and daily bread on its back, they themselves
declined. For every fathom that the ocean stole
nearer to the threshold of their home, nibbling at their
good earth, their status and courage grew correspondingly
less.</p>

<p>For a long time they struggled against it, and clung
to the land until necessity drove them back to the sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Sören was the first to give himself entirely up to it:
he took his wife from the hamlet and became a fisherman.
But they were none the better for it. Maren
could never forget that her Sören belonged to a family
who had owned a farm; and so it was with the children.
The sons cared little for the sea, it was in them to
struggle with the land and therefore they sought work
on farms and became day-laborers and ditchers, and
as soon as they saved sufficient money, emigrated to
America. Four sons were farming over there. They
were seldom heard of, misfortune seemed to have worn
out their feeling of relationship. The daughters went
out to service, and after a time Sören and Maren lost
sight of them, too. Only the youngest, Sörine, stayed
at home longer than was usual with poor folks' children.
She was not particularly strong, and her parents
thought a great deal of her&mdash;as being the only one they
had left.</p>

<p>It had been a long business for Sören's ancestors to
work themselves up from the sea to the ownership of
cultivated land; it had taken several generations to
build up the farm on the Naze. But the journey down
hill was as usual more rapid, and to Sören was left the
worst part of all when he inherited; not only acres but
possessions had gone; nothing was left now but a poor
man's remains.</p>

<p>The end was in many ways like the beginning. Sören
was like the original man in this also, that he too was
amphibious. He understood everything, farming, fishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and handicraft. But he was not sharp enough to
do more than just earn a bare living, there was never
anything to spare. This was the difference between
the ascent and the descent. Moreover, he&mdash;like so
many of the family&mdash;found it difficult to attend to his
own business.</p>

<p>It was a race which allowed others to gather the
first-fruits of their labors. It was said of them that
they were just like sheep, the more the wool was
clipped, the thicker it grew. The downfall had not
made Sören any more capable of standing up for himself.</p>

<p>When the weather was too stormy for him to go to
sea, and there was nothing to do on his little homestead,
he sat at home and patched seaboots for his friends
down in the hamlet. But he seldom got paid for it.
"Leave it till next time," said they. And Sören had
nothing much to say against this arrangement, it was
to him just as good as a savings bank. "Then one has
something for one's old days," said he. Maren and the
girl were always scolding him for this, but Sören in
this as in everything else, did not amend his ways.
He knew well enough what women were; they never
put by for a rainy day.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_II" id="I_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
Before The Birth</span></h2>


<p>The children were now out of their care&mdash;that
is to say, all the eight of them. Sören and
Maren were now no longer young. The wear and
tear of time and toil began to be felt; and it would
have been good to have had something as a stand-by.
Sörine, the youngest, was as far as that goes, also out
of their care, in that she was grown up and ought long
ago to have been pushed out of the nest; but there
was a reason for her still remaining at home supported
by her old parents.</p>

<p>She was very much spoiled, this girl&mdash;as the youngest
can easily be; she was delicate and bashful with
strangers. But, as Maren thought, when one has given
so many children to the world, it was pleasant to keep
one of them for themselves; nests without young ones
soon become cold. Sören in the main thought just the
same, even if he did grumble and argue that one woman
in the house was more than enough. They were equally
fond of children. And hearing so seldom from the
others they clung more closely to the last one. So
Sörine remained at home and only occasionally took
outside work in the hamlet or at the nearest farms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
behind the downs. She was supposed to be a pretty girl,
and against this Sören had nothing to say: but what he
could see was that she did not thrive, her red hair stood
like a flame round her clear, slightly freckled forehead,
her limbs were fragile, and strength in her there was
none. When speaking to people she could not meet
their eyes, her own wandered anxiously away.</p>

<p>The young boys from the hamlet came wooing over
the downs and hung round the hut&mdash;preferably on the
warm nights; but she hid herself and was afraid of
them.</p>

<p>"She takes after the bad side of the family," said
Sören, when he saw how tightly she kept her window
closed.</p>

<p>"She takes after the fine side," said the mother
then. "Just you wait and see, she will marry a gentleman's
son."</p>

<p>"Fool," growled Sören angrily and went his way:
"to fill both her own and the girl's head with such
rubbish!"</p>

<p>He was fond enough of Maren, but her intellect
had never won his respect. As the children grew up
and did wrong in one way or another, Sören always
said: "What a fool the child is&mdash;it takes after its
mother." And Maren, as years went on, bore patiently
with this; she knew quite as well as Sören that it was
not intellect that counted.</p>

<p>Two or three times in the week, Sörine went up
town with a load of fish and brought goods home again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
It was a long way to walk, and part of the road went
through a pine wood where it was dark in the evening
and tramps hung about.</p>

<p>"Oh, trash," said Sören, "the girl may just as well
try a little of everything, it will make a woman of her."</p>

<p>But Maren wished to shelter her child, as long as
she could. And so she arranged it in this way, that her
daughter could drive home in the cart from Sands
farm which was then carrying grain for the brewery.</p>

<p>The arrangement was good, inasmuch as Sörine need
no longer go in fear of tramps, and all that a timid
young girl might encounter; but, on the other hand, it
did not answer Maren's expectations. Far from having
taken any harm from the long walks, it was now proved
what good they had done her. She became even more
delicate than before, and dainty about her food.</p>

<p>This agreed well with the girl's otherwise gentle
manners. In spite of the trouble it gave her, this new
phase was a comfort to Maren. It took the last remaining
doubt from her heart: it was now irrevocably
settled. Sörine was a gentlefolks' child, not by birth,
of course&mdash;for Maren knew well enough who was
father and who mother to the girl, whatever Sören
might have thought&mdash;but by gift of grace. It did happen
that such were found in a poor man's cradle, and
they were always supposed to bring joy to their parents.
Herrings and potatoes, flounders and potatoes and a
little bacon in between&mdash;this was no fare for what
one might call a young lady. Maren made little delicacies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
for her, and when Sören saw it, he spat as if he
had something nasty in his mouth and went his way.</p>

<p>But, after all one can be too fastidious, and when at
last the girl could not keep down even an omelet, it was
too much of a good thing for Maren. She took her
daughter up to a wise woman who lived on the common.
Three times did she try her skill on Sörine, with no
avail. So Sören had to borrow a horse and cart and
drove them in to the homeopathist. He did it very
unwillingly. Not because he did not care for the girl,
and it might be possible, as Maren said, that as she
slept, an animal or evil spirit might have found its
way into her mouth and now prevented the food from
going down. Such things had been heard of before.
But actually to make fools of themselves on this account&mdash;rushing
off with horse and cart to the doctor just as
the gentry did, and make themselves, too, the laughing
stock of the whole hamlet, when a draught of tansy
would have the same effect&mdash;this was what Sören could
not put up with.</p>

<p>But, of course, although the daily affairs were settled
by Sören Man, there were occasions when Maren
insisted on having her way&mdash;more so when it seriously
affected <i>her</i> offspring. Then she could&mdash;as with witchcraft&mdash;suddenly
forget her good behavior, brush aside
Sören's arguments as endless nonsense, and would stand
there like a stone wall which one could neither climb
over, nor get round. Afterwards he would be sorry
that the magic word which should have brought Maren
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
down from her high and mightiness, failed him at the
critical moment. For she <i>was</i> a fool&mdash;especially when
it affected her offspring. But, whether right or wrong,
when she had her great moments, fate spoke through
her mouth, and Sören was wise enough to remain
silent.</p>

<p>This time it certainly seemed as if Maren was in the
right; for the cure which the homeopathist prescribed,
effervescent powder and sweet milk, had a wonderful
effect. Sörine throve and grew fat, so that it was a
pleasure to see her.</p>

<p>There can be too much of a good thing, and Sören
Man, who had to provide the food, was the first to
think of this. Sörine and her mother talked much
together and wondered what the illness could be, could
it be this or could it be that? There was a great to-do
and much talking with their heads together; but, as soon
as Sören appeared, they became silent.</p>

<p>He had become quite unreasonable, going about muttering
and swearing. As though it was not hard
enough already, especially for the poor girl! He had
no patience with a sick person, beggar that he was;
and one day it broke out from him with bitterness and
rage: "She must be&mdash;it can be nothing else."</p>

<p>But like a tiger, Maren was upon him.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, you old stupid? Have
<i>you</i> borne eight children, or has the girl told you what's
amiss? A sin and a shame it is to let her hear such
talk; but now it is done, you might just as well ask her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
yourself. Answer your father, Sörine&mdash;is it true, what
he says?"</p>

<p>Sörine sat drooping by the fireplace, suffering and
scared. "Then it would be like the Virgin Mary," she
whispered, without looking up. And suddenly sank
down, sobbing.</p>

<p>"There, you can see yourself, what a blockhead you
are," said Maren harshly. "The girl is as pure as an
unborn child. And here you come, making all this
racket in the house, while the child, perhaps, may be
on the point of death."</p>

<p>Sören Man bowed his head, and hurried out on to
the downs. Ugh! it was just like thunder overhead.
Blockhead she had called him&mdash;for the first time in the
whole of their life together; he would have liked to
have forced that word home again and that, at once,
before it stuck to him. But to face a mad, old wife
and a howling girl&mdash;no, he kept out of it.</p>

<p>Sören Man was an obstinate fellow; when once he
got a thing into his three-cornered head, nothing could
hammer it out again. He said nothing, but went about
with a face which said: "Ay, best not to come to words
with women folk!" Maren, however, did not misunderstand
him. Well, as long as he kept it to himself.
There was the girl torturing herself, drinking petroleum,
and eating soft soap as if she were mad, because
she had heard it was good for internal weakness. It
was too bad; it was adding insult to injury to be jeered
at&mdash;by her own father too.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>At that time he was as little at home as possible, and
Maren had no objection as it kept him and his angry
glare out of their way. When not at sea, he lounged
about doing odd jobs, or sat gossiping high up on the
downs, from where one could keep an eye on every
boat going out or coming in. Generally, he was allowed
to go in peace, but when Sörine was worse than usual,
Maren would come running&mdash;piteous to see in her
motherly anxiety&mdash;and beg him to take the girl in to
town to be examined before it was too late. Then he
would fall into a passion and shout&mdash;not caring who
might hear: "Confound you, you old nuisance&mdash;have
you had eight children yourself and still can't see what
ails the girl?"</p>

<p>Before long he would repent, for it was impossible
to do without house and home altogether; but immediately
he put his foot inside the door the trouble began.
What was he to do? He had to let off steam, to
prevent himself from going mad altogether with all
this woman's quibbling. Whatever the result might
be, he was tempted to stand on the highest hill and
shout his opinion over the whole hamlet, just for the
pleasure of getting his own back.</p>

<p>One day, as he was sitting on the shore weighting
the net, Maren came flying over the downs: "Now, you
had better send for the doctor," said she, "or the girl
will slip through our fingers. She's taking on so, it's
terrible to hear."</p>

<p>Sören also had himself heard moans from the hut;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
he was beside himself with anger and flung a pebble
at her. "Confound you, are you deaf too, that you
cannot hear what that sound means?" shouted he.
"See and get hold of a midwife&mdash;and that at once; or
I'll teach you."</p>

<p>When Maren saw him rise, she turned round and ran
home again. Sören shrugged his shoulders and fetched
the midwife himself. He stayed outside the hut the
whole afternoon without going in, and when it was
evening he went down to the inn. It was a place within
which he seldom set his foot; there was not sufficient
money for that; if house and home should have
what was due to it. With unaccustomed shaking
hand he turned the handle, opened the door with a
jerk and stood with an uncertain air in the doorway.</p>

<p>"So, that was it, after all," said he with miserable
bravado. And he repeated the same sentence over and
over again the whole evening, until it was time to
stumble home.</p>

<p>Maren was out on the down waiting for him; when
she saw the state he was in, she burst into tears. "So,
that was&mdash;&mdash;" he began, with a look which should have
been full of withering scorn&mdash;but suddenly he stopped.
Maren's tears moved him strangely deep down under
everything else; he had to put his arms round her neck
and join in her tears.</p>

<p>The two old people sat on the down holding each
other until their tears were spent. Already considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
evil had fallen in the path of this new being; now
fell the first tears.</p>

<p>When they had got home and busied themselves with
mother and child and had gone to rest in the big
double bed, Maren felt for Sören's hand. So she had
always fallen asleep in their young days, and now it was
as if something of the sweetness of their young days
rose up in her again&mdash;was it really owing to the little
lovechild's sudden appearance, or what?</p>

<p>"Now, perhaps, you'll agree 'twas as I told you all
along," said Sören, just as they were falling asleep.</p>

<p>"Ay, 'twas so," said Maren. "But how it could
come about ... for men folk...."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up with that nonsense," said Sören, and
they went to sleep.</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>So Maren eventually had to give in. "Though,"
as Sören said, "like as not one fine day she'd swear the
girl had never had a child." Womenfolk! Ugh! there
was no persuading them.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Maren was too clever to deny what even a
blind man could see with a stick; and it was ever so
much easier for her to admit the hard truth; in spite
of the girl's innocent tears and solemn assurances, there
was a man in the case all the same, and he moreover,
the farmer's son. It was the son of the owner of
Sands farm, whom Sörine had driven home with from
the town&mdash;in fear of the dark forest.</p>

<p>"Ay, you managed it finely&mdash;keeping the girl away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
from vagabonds," said Sören, looking out of the
corners of his eyes towards the new arrival.</p>

<p>"Rubbish! A farmer's son is better than a vagabond,
anyway," answered Maren proudly.</p>

<p>After all it was she who was right; had she not
always said there was refinement in Sörine? There was
blue blood in the girl!</p>

<p>One day, Sören had to put on his best clothes and
off he went to Sands farm.</p>

<p>"'Twas with child she was, after all," said he, going
straight to the point. "'Tis just born."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it," said the farmer's son who stood with
his father on the thrashing-floor shaking out some
straw. "Well, that's as it may be!"</p>

<p>"Ay, but she says you're the father."</p>

<p>"Oh, does she! Can she prove it, I'd like to
know."</p>

<p>"She can take her oath on it, she can. So you had
better marry the girl."</p>

<p>The farmer's son shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, you laugh, do you?" Sören picked up a hayfork
and made for the lad, who hid behind the threshing-machine,
livid with fear.</p>

<p>"Look here," the boy's father broke in: "Don't
you think we two old ones had better go outside and
talk the matter over? Young folk nowadays are foolish.
Whatever the boy's share in the matter may be,
I don't believe he'll marry her," began he, as they
were outside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"That he shall, though," answered Sören, threateningly.</p>

<p>"Look you, the one thing to compel him is the law&mdash;and
that she will not take, if I know anything about
her. But, I'll not say but he might help the girl to a
proper marriage&mdash;will you take two hundred crowns
once and for all?"</p>

<p>Sören thought in his own mind that it was a large
sum of money for a poor babe, and hurried to close the
bargain in case the farmer might draw back.</p>

<p>"But, no gossip, mind you, now. No big talk about
relationship and that kind of thing," said the farmer as
he followed Sören out of the gate. "The child must
take the girl's name&mdash;and no claim on us."</p>

<p>"No, of course not!" said Sören, eager to be off.
He had got the two hundred crowns in his inner pocket,
and was afraid the farmer might demand them back
again.</p>

<p>"I'll send you down a paper one of these days and
get your receipt for the money," said the farmer. "It
is best to have it fixed up all right and legal."</p>

<p>He said the word "legal" with such emphasis
and familiarity that Sören was more than a little
startled.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," was all Sören said and slipped into the
porch with his cap between his hands. It was not
often he took his hat off to any one, but the two hundred
crowns had given him respect for the farmer. The
people of Sands farm were a race who, if they did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
break down their neighbor's fence, always made good
the damage they had done.</p>

<p>Sören started off and ran over the fields. The money
was more than he and Maren had ever before possessed.
All he had to do now was to lay out the notes
in front of her so as to make a show that she might
be impressed. For Maren had fixed her mind on the
farmer's son.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_III" id="I_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
A Child Is Born</span></h2>


<p>There are a milliard and a half of stars in the
heavens, and&mdash;as far as we know&mdash;a milliard
and a half of human beings on the earth. Exactly
the same number of both! One would almost
think the old saying was right,&mdash;that every human
being was born under his own star. In hundreds of
costly observatories all over the world, on plain and
mountain, talented scientists are adjusting the finest
instruments and peering out into the heavens. They
watch and take photographic plates, their whole life
taken up with the one idea: to make themselves immortal
with having discovered a new star. Another
celestial body&mdash;added to the milliard and a half already
moving gracefully round.</p>

<p>Every second a human soul is born into the world.
A new flame is lit, a star which perhaps may come to
shine with unusual beauty, which in any case has its own
unseen spectrum. A new being, fated, perhaps, to bestow
genius, perhaps beauty around it, kisses the earth;
the unseen becomes flesh and blood. No human being
is a repetition of another, nor is any ever reproduced;
each new being is like a comet which only once in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
eternity touches the path of the earth, and for a brief
time takes its luminous way over it&mdash;a phosphorescent
body between two eternities of darkness. No doubt
there is joy amongst human beings for every newly lit
soul! And, no doubt they will stand round the cradle
with questioning eyes, wondering what this new one
will bring forth.</p>

<p>Alas, a human being is no star, bringing fame to him
who discovers and records it! More often, it is a
parasite which comes upon peaceful and unsuspecting
people, sneaking itself into the world&mdash;through months
of purgatory. God help it, if into the bargain it has
not its papers in order.</p>

<p>Sörine's little one had bravely pushed itself into the
light of day, surmounting all obstacles, denial, tears
and preventatives, as a salmon springs against the
stream. Now she lay in the daylight, red and wrinkled,
trying to soften all hearts.</p>

<p>The whole of the community had done with her, she
was a parasite and nothing else. A newly born human
being is a figure in the transaction which implies proper
marriage and settling down, and the next step which
means a cradle and perambulator and&mdash;as it grows up&mdash;an
engagement ring, marriage and children again.
Much of this procedure is upset when a child like
Sörine's little one is vulgar enough to allow itself to be
born without marriage.</p>

<p>She was from the very first treated accordingly, without
maudlin consideration for her tender helplessness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
"Born out of wedlock" was entered on her certificate
of birth which the midwife handed to the schoolmaster
when she had helped the little one into the world, and
the same was noted on the baptismal certificate. It was
as if they all, the midwife, the schoolmaster and the
parson, leaders of the community, in righteous vengeance
were striking the babe with all their might.
What matter if the little soul were begotten by the son
of a farmer, when he refused to acknowledge it, and
bought himself out of the marriage? A nuisance she
was, and a blot on the industrious orderly community.</p>

<p>She was just as much of an inconvenience to her
mother as to all the others. When Sörine was up and
about again, she announced that she might just as well
go out to service as all her sisters had done. Her fear
of strangers had quite disappeared: she took a place
a little further inland. The child remained with the
grandparents.</p>

<p>No one in the wide world cared for the little one, not
even the old people for that matter. But all the same
Maren went up into the attic and brought out an old
wooden cradle which had for many years been used
for yarn and all kinds of lumber; Sören put new rockers,
and once more Maren's old, swollen legs had to accustom
themselves to rocking a cradle again.</p>

<p>A blot the little one was to her grandparents too&mdash;perhaps,
when all is said and done, on them alone.
They had promised themselves such great things of the
girl&mdash;and there lay their hopes&mdash;an illegitimate child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
in the cradle! It was brought home to them by the
women running to Maren, saying: "Well, how do you
like having little ones again in your old days?" And
by the other fishermen when Sören Man came to the
harbor or the inn. His old comrades poked fun at him
good-naturedly and said: "All very well for him&mdash;strong
as a young man and all, Sören, you ought to
stand treat all round."</p>

<p>But it had to be borne&mdash;and, after all, it could be
got over. And the child was&mdash;when one got one's hand
in again&mdash;a little creature who recalled so much that
otherwise belonged to the past. It was just as if one
had her oneself&mdash;in a way she brought youth to the
house.</p>

<p>It was utterly impossible not to care for such a helpless
little creature.</p>




<hr class="chapbreak" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_IV" id="I_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
Ditte's First Step</span></h2>


<p>Strange how often one bears the child while
another cares for it. For old Maren it was not
easy to be a mother again, much as her heart was in
it. The girl herself had got over all difficulties, and
was right away in service in another county; and here
was the babe left behind screaming.</p>

<p>Maren attended to it as well as she could, procured
good milk and gave it soaked bread and sugar, and did
all she could to make up for its mother.</p>

<p>Her daughter she could not make out at all. Sörine
rarely came home, and preferably in the evening when
no one could see her; the child she appeared not
to care for at all. She had grown strong and erect,
not in the least like the slender, freckled girl who could
stand next to nothing. Her blood had thickened and
her manners were decided; though that, of course, has
happened before,&mdash;an ailing woman transformed by
having a child, as one might say, released from witchcraft.</p>

<p>Ditte herself did not seem to miss a mother's tender
care: she grew well in spite of the artificial food, and
soon became so big that she could keep wooden shoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
on her small feet, and, with the help of old Sören's
hand, walk on the downs. And then she was well
looked after.</p>

<p>However, at times things would go badly. For
Maren had quite enough of her own work to do, which
could not be neglected, and the little one was everywhere.
And difficult it was suddenly to throw up what
one had in hand&mdash;letting the milk boil over and the
porridge burn&mdash;for the sake of running after the little
one. Maren took a pride in her housework and found
it hard at times to choose between the two. Then,
God preserve her: the little one had to take her
chance.</p>

<p>Ditte took it as it came and could be thankful that
she was with her grandparents. She was an inquisitive
little being, eager to meddle with everything; and a
miracle it was that the firewood did not fall down.
Hundreds of times in the day did she get into scrapes,
heedless and thoughtless as she was. She would rush
out, and lucky it was if there was anything to step
on, otherwise she would have fallen down. Her little
head was full of bruises, and she could never learn
to look after herself in spite of all the knocks she got.
It was too bad to be whipped into the bargain! When
the hurt was very bad, Grandfather had to blow it, or
Granny put the cold blade of the bread-knife on the
bruise to make it well again.</p>

<p>"Better now," said she, turning a smiling face
towards her granny; the tears still hanging on the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
lashes, and her cheeks gradually becoming roughened
by them.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," answered Maren. "But, Girlie must
take care."</p>

<p>This was her name in those days, and a real little
girlie she was, square and funny. It was impossible to
be angry with her, although at times she could make
it somewhat difficult for the old ones. Her little head
would not accept the fact that there were things one
was not allowed to do; immediately she got an idea,
her small hands acted upon it. "She's no forethought,"
said Sören significantly, "she's a woman. Wonder if a
little rap over the fingers after all wouldn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Maren ignored this. Took the child inside with
her and explained, perhaps for the hundredth time,
that Girlie must not do so. And one day she had a
narrow escape. Ditte had been up to mischief as usual
in her careless way. But when she had finished, she
offered her little pouting mouth to the two old ones:
"Kiss me then&mdash;and say 'beg pardon'," said she.</p>

<p>And who could resist her?</p>

<p>"Now, perhaps, you'll say that she can't be taught
what's right and wrong?" said Maren.</p>

<p>Sören laughed: "Ay, she first does the thing, and
waits till after to think if it's right or wrong. She'll
be a true woman, right enough."</p>

<p>At one time Ditte got into the habit of pulling down
and breaking things. She always had her little snub
nose into everything, and being too small to see what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
was on the table, she pulled it down instead. Sören had
to get a drill and learn to mend earthenware to make up
for the worst of her depredations. A great many
things fell over Ditte without alarming her in the
least.</p>

<p>"She'll neither break nor bend&mdash;she's a woman all
over," said Sören, inwardly rather proud of her power
of endurance. But Maren had to be ever on the watch,
and was in daily fear for the things and the child
herself.</p>

<p>One day Ditte spilled a basin of hot milk over herself
and was badly scalded; that cured her of inquisitiveness.
Maren put her to bed and treated her burns with egg-oil
and slices of new potato; and it was some time
before Ditte was herself again. But when she was
again about, there was not so much as a scar to be
seen. This accident made Maren famous as a curer
of burns and people sought her help for their injuries.
"You're a wise one," said they, and gave her bacon
or fish by way of thanks. "But 'tis not to be wondered
at, after all."</p>

<p>The allusion to the fact that her mother had been
a "wise woman" did not please Maren at all. But
the bacon and the herrings came to an empty cupboard,
and&mdash;as Sören said: "Beggars cannot be choosers and
must swallow their pride with their food."</p>

<p>Ditte shot up like a young plant, day by day putting
forth new leaves. She was no sooner in the midst of
one difficult situation, and her troubled grandparents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
putting their heads together, had decided to take strong
measures, than she was out of it again and into something
else. It was just like sailing over a flat bottom&mdash;thought
Sören&mdash;passing away under one and making
room for something new. The old ones could not help
wondering if they themselves and their children had
ever been like this. They had never thought of it
before, having had little time to spend on their offspring
beyond what was strictly necessary; the one had quite
enough to do in procuring food and the other in keeping
the home together. But now they could not <i>help</i>
thinking; however much they had to do, and they
marveled much over many things.</p>

<p>"'Tis strange how a bit of a child can open a body's
eyes, for all one's old. Ay, there's a lot to learn," said
Maren.</p>

<p>"Stupid," said Sören. From his tone it could be
gathered that he himself had been thinking the same.</p>

<p>Ditte was indeed full of character. Little as she had
had to inherit, she nevertheless was richly endowed;
her first smile brought joy; her feeble tears, sorrow. A
gift she was, born out of emptiness, thrown up on the
beach for the wornout old couple. No one had done
anything to deserve her,&mdash;on the contrary, all had done
their utmost to put her out of existence. Notwithstanding,
there she lay one day with blinking eyes, blue
and innocent as the skies of heaven. Anxiety she
brought from the very beginning, many footsteps had
trodden round her cradle, and questioning thoughts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
surrounded her sleep. It was even more exciting when
she began to take notice; when only a week old she
knew their faces, and at three she laughed to Sören.
He was quite foolish that day and in the evening had
to go down to the <a class="corr" name="TC_1" id="TC_1" title="taproom">tap-room</a> to tell them all about it.
Had any one ever known such a child? She could laugh
already! And when she first began to understand play,
it was difficult to tear oneself away&mdash;particularly for
Sören. Every other moment he had to go in and caress
her with his crooked fingers. Nothing was so delightful
as to have the room filled with her gurgling, and
Maren had to chase him away from the cradle, at least
twenty times a day. And when she took her first
toddling steps!&mdash;that little helpless, illegitimate child
who had come defiantly into existence, and who, in return
for life brightened the days of the two old wornout
people. It had become pleasant once more to wake
in the morning to a new day: life was worth living
again.</p>

<p>Her stumbling, slow walk was in itself a pleasure;
and the contemplative gravity with which she crossed
the doorstep, both hands full, trotted down the road&mdash;straight
on as if there was nothing behind her, and
with drooping head&mdash;was altogether irresistible. Then
Maren would slink out round the corner and beckon to
Sören to make haste and come, and Sören would throw
down his ax and come racing over the grass of the
downs with his tongue between his lips. "Heaven only
knows what she is up to now," said he, and the two crept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
after her down the road. When she had wandered a
little distance, in deep thought, she would suddenly
realize her loneliness, and begin to howl, a picture of
misery, left alone and forsaken. Then the two old
people would appear on the scene, and she would throw
herself into their arms overjoyed at finding them again.</p>

<p>Then quite suddenly she got over it&mdash;the idea that
things were gone forever if she lost sight of them for
a moment. She began to look out and up into people's
faces: hitherto, she had only seen the feet of those who
came within her horizon. One day she actually went
off by herself, having caught sight of the houses down
in the hamlet. They had to look after her more seriously
now that the outside world had tempted her.</p>

<p>"We're not enough for her, seems like," said Sören
despondently, "got a fancy for the unknown already."</p>

<p>It was the first time she had turned away from
them, and Sören recognized in that something of what
he had experienced before, and for a moment a feeling
of loneliness came over him. But Maren, wise as she
had grown since the coming of the little one, again
found a way. She threw her kerchief over her head
and went down to the hamlet with Ditte, to let her
play with other children.</p>




<hr class="chapbreak" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_V" id="I_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
Grandfather Strikes Out Afresh</span></h2>


<p>All that Sören possessed&mdash;with the exception of
the house&mdash;was a third share in a boat and gear.
He had already, before Ditte came into the world,
let out his part of the boat to a young fisher boy
from the hamlet, who having no money to buy a share
in a boat repaid Sören with half of his catch. It
was not much, but he and Maren had frugal habits,
and as to Sören, she occasionally went out to work
and helped to make ends meet. They just managed to
scrape along with their sixth share of the catch, and
such odd jobs as Sören could do at home.</p>

<p>Once again there was a little one to feed and clothe.
For the present, of course, Ditte's requirements were
small, but her advent had opened out new prospects.
It was no good now to be content with toiling the time
away, until one's last resting-place was reached, patiently
thinking the hut would pay for the burial. It
was not sufficient to wear out old clothes, eat dried fish,
and keep out of the workhouse until they were well
under the ground. Sören and Maren were now no
longer at the end of things, there was one in the cradle
who demanded everything from the beginning, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
spurred them on to new efforts. It would never do to
let their infirmity grow upon them or allow themselves
to become pensioners on what a sixth share of a boat
might happen to bring home. Duty called for a new
start.</p>

<p>The old days had left their mark on them both.
They came into line with the little one, even her childish
cries under the low ceiling carried the old couple a
quarter of a century back, to the days when the weight
of years was not yet felt, and they could do their work
with ease. And once there, the way to still earlier
days was not so far&mdash;to that beautiful time when
tiredness was unknown, and Sören after a hard day's
work would walk miles over the common, to where
Maren was in service, stay with her until dawn, and
then walk miles back home again, to be the first man at
work.</p>

<p>Inevitably they were young again! Had they not a
little one in the house? A little pouting mouth was
screaming and grunting for milk. Sören came out of
his old man's habit, and turned his gaze once more
towards the sea and sky. He took back his share in the
boat and went to sea again.</p>

<p>Things went tolerably well to begin with. It was
summer time when Ditte had pushed him back to his
old occupation again; it was as if she had really given
the old people a second youth. But it was hard to keep
up with the others, in taking an oar and pulling up
nets by the hour. Moreover in the autumn when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
herrings were deeper in the sea, the nets went right
down, and were often caught by the heavy undertow,
Sören had not strength to draw them up like the other
men, and had to put up with the offer of lighter work.
This was humiliating; and even more humiliating was
it to break down from night watches in the cold, when
he knew how strong he had been in days gone by.</p>

<p>Sören turned to the memories of old days for support,
that he might assert himself over the others. Far
and wide he told tales of his youth, to all who would
listen.</p>

<p>In those days implements were poor, and clothes
were thin, and the winter was harder than now. There
was ice everywhere, and in order to obtain food they
had to trail over the ice with their gear on a wooden
sledge right out to the great channel, and chop holes
to fish through. Woollen underclothing was unknown,
and oilskins were things none could afford; a pair of
thick leather trousers were worn&mdash;with stockings and
wooden shoes. Often one fell in&mdash;and worked on in
wet clothes, which were frozen so stiff that it was impossible
to draw them off.</p>

<p>To Sören it was a consolation to dwell upon all this,
when he had to give up such strenuous work as the
rowing over to the Swedish coast, before he could get a
good catch. There he would sit in the stern feeling
small and useless, talking away and fidgeting with the
sails in spite of the lack of wind. His partners, toiling
with the heavy oars, hardly listened to him. It was all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
true enough, they knew that from their fathers, but it
gained nothing in being repeated by Sören's toothless
mouth. His boasting did not make the boat any lighter
to pull; old Sören was like a stone in the net.</p>

<p>Maren was probably the only one, who at her own
expense could afford to give a helping hand. She saw
how easily he became tired, try as he would to hide
it from her&mdash;and she made up her mind to trust in
Providence for food. It was hard for him to turn
out in the middle of the night, his old limbs were as
heavy as lead, and Maren had to help him up in bed.</p>

<p>"'Tis rough tonight!" said she, "stay at home and
rest." And the next night she would persuade him
again, with another excuse. She took care not to
suggest that he should give up the sea entirely; Sören
was stubborn and proud. Could she only keep him at
home from time to time, the question would soon be
decided by his partners.</p>

<p>So Sören remained at home first one day and then
another; Maren said that he was ill. He fell easily
into the trap, and when this had gone on for some
little time, his partners got tired of it, and forced him
to sell his part of the boat and implements. Now that
he was driven to remain at home, he grumbled and
scolded, but settled down to it after a while. He busied
himself with odd jobs, patched oilskins and mended
wooden shoes for the fishermen and became quite brisk
again. Maren could feel the improvement, when he
good-naturedly began to chaff her again as before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>He was happiest out on the downs, with Ditte holding
his hand, looking after the sheep. Sören could
hardly do without the little one; when she was not
holding his hand, he felt like a cripple without his staff.
Was it not he whom she had chosen for her first smile,
when but three weeks old! And when only four or five
months old dropped her comforter and turned her
head on hearing his tottering steps.</p>

<p>"'Tis all very well for you," said Maren half annoyed.
"'Tis you she plays with, while I've the looking
after and feeding of her; and that's another thing."
But in her heart she did not grudge him first place with
the little one; after all he was the man&mdash;and needed
a little happiness.</p>

<p>There was no one who understood Ditte as did her
grandfather. They two could entertain each other by
the hour. They spoke about sheep and ships and trees,
which Ditte did not like, because they stood and made
the wind blow. Sören explained to her that it was
God who made the wind blow&mdash;so that the fishermen
need not toil with their oars so much. Trees on the
contrary did no work at all and as a punishment God
had chained them to the spot.</p>

<p>"What does God look like?" asked Ditte. The
question staggered Sören. There he had lived a long
life and always professed the religion taught him in
childhood; at times when things looked dark, he had
even called upon God; nevertheless, it had never occurred
to him to consider what the good God really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
looked like. And here he was confounded by the words
of a little child, exactly as in the Bible.</p>

<p>"God?" began Sören hesitating on the word, to gain
time. "Well, He's both His hands full, He has. And
even so it seems to us others, that at times He's taken
more upon Himself than He can do&mdash;and that's what
He looks like!"</p>

<p>And so Ditte was satisfied.</p>

<p>To begin with Sören talked most, and the child listened.
But soon it was she who led the conversation,
and the old man who listened entranced. Everything
his girlie said was simply wonderful, and all of it
worth repetition, if only he could remember it. Sören
remembered a good deal, but was annoyed with himself
when some of it escaped his memory.</p>

<p>"Never knew such a child," said he to Maren, when
they came in from their walk. "She's different from
our girls somehow."</p>

<p>"Well, you see she's the child of a farmer's son,"
answered Maren, who had never got over the greatest
disappointment of her life, and eagerly caught at anything
that might soften it.</p>

<p>But Sören laughed scornfully and said: "You're a
fool, Maren, and that's all about it."</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_VI" id="I_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
The Death Of Sören Man</span></h2>


<p>One day Sören came crawling on all fours over
the doorstep. Once inside, he stumbled to his
feet and moved with great difficulty towards the
fireplace, where he clung with both hands to the
mantelpiece, swaying to and fro and groaning pitifully
the while. He collapsed just as Maren came in from
the kitchen, she ran to him, got off his clothes and put
him to bed.</p>

<p>"Seems like I'm done for now," said Sören, when he
had rested a little.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with you, Sören?" asked Maren
anxiously.</p>

<p>"'Tis naught but something's given inside," said
Sören sullenly.</p>

<p>He refused to say more, but Maren got out of him
afterwards that it had happened when drawing the
tethering-peg out of the ground. Usually it was loose
enough. But today it was firm as a rock, as if some
one was holding it down in the earth. Sören put the
tethering-rope round his neck and pulled with all his
might, it did give way; but at the same time something
seemed to break inside him. Everything went dark,
and a big black hole appeared in the earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Maren gazed at him with terror. "Was 't square?"
asked she.</p>

<p>Sören thought it was square.</p>

<p>"And what of Girlie?" asked Maren suddenly.</p>

<p>She had disappeared when Sören fainted.</p>

<p>Maren ran out on the hills with anxious eyes. She
found Ditte playing in the midst of a patch of wild
pansies, fortunately Maren could find no hole in the
ground. But the old rotten rope had parted. Sören,
unsteady on his feet, had probably fallen backwards
and hurt himself. Maren knotted the rope together
again and went towards the little one. "Come along,
dearie," said she, "we'll go home and make a nice cup
of coffee for Grandad." But suddenly she stood transfixed.
Was it not a cross the child had plaited of
grass, and set among the pansies? Quietly Maren took
the child by the hand and went in. Now she knew.</p>

<p>Sören stayed in bed. There was no outward hurt to
be seen, but he showed no inclination to get up. He
hardly slept at all, but lay all day long gazing at the
ceiling, and fumbling with the bedclothes.</p>

<p>Now and then he groaned, and Maren would hurry
to his side. "What ails you, Sören, can't you tell me?"
said she earnestly.</p>

<p>"Ails me? Nothing ails me, Maren, but death,"
answered Sören. Maren would have liked to try her
own remedies on him, but might just as well spare her
arts for a better occasion; Sören had seen a black hole
in the ground; there was no cure for that.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>So matters stood. Maren knew as well as he, that
this was the end; but she was a sturdy nature, and never
liked to give in. She would have wrestled with God
himself for Sören, had there been anything definite to
fight about. But he was fading away, and for this there
was no cure; though if only the poison could be got out
of his blood, he might even yet be strong again.</p>

<p>"Maybe 'tis bleeding you want."</p>

<p>But Sören refused to be bled. "Folks die quickly
enough without," said he, incredulous as he had always
been. Maren was silent and went back to her work
with a sigh. Sören never did believe in anything, he
was just as unbelieving as he had been in his young days&mdash;if
only God would not be too hard on him.</p>

<p>At first Sören longed to have the child with him
always, and every other minute Maren had to bring her
to the bedside. The little one did not like to sit quietly
on a chair beside Grandad's bed, and as soon as she
saw a chance of escape, off she would run. This was
hardest of all to Sören, he felt alone and forsaken,
all was blackness and despair.</p>

<p>Before long, however, he lost all interest in the child,
as he did in everything else. His mind began to wander
from the present back to bygone days; Maren knew
well what it meant. He went further and still further
back to his youth and childhood. Strange it was how
much he could remember things which otherwise had
been forgotten. And it was not rambling nonsense
that he talked, but all true enough; people older than he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
who came from the hamlet to visit him confirmed it,
and wondered at hearing him speak of events that
must have happened when he was but two or three
years old. Sören forgot the latter years of his life,
indeed he might never have lived them so completely
had they faded from his mind.</p>

<p>This saddened Maren. They had lived a long life,
and gone through so much together, and how much
more pleasant it would have been, if they could have
talked of the past together once more before they
parted. But Sören would not listen, when it came to
their mutual memories. No, the garden on the old
farm&mdash;where Sören lived when five years old&mdash;that he
could remember! Where this tree stood, and that&mdash;and
what kind of fruit it bore.</p>

<p>And when he had gone as far back as he could
remember, his mind would wander forward again,
and in his delirium he would rave of his days as a
shepherd boy or sailor boy and heaven knows
what.</p>

<p>In his uneasy dreams he mixed up all his experiences,
the travels of his youth, his work and difficulties. At
one minute he would be on the sea furling sail in the
storm, the next he would struggle with the ground.
Maren who stood over him listened with terror to all
that he toiled with; he seemed to be taking his life in
one long stride. Many were the tribulations he had
been through, and of which she now heard for the
first time. When his mind cleared once more, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
would be worn out with beads of perspiration standing
on his forehead.</p>

<p>His old partners came to see him, and then they went
through it again&mdash;Sören <i>had</i> to talk of old times. He
could only say a few words, weak as he was; but then
the others would continue. Maren begged them not
to speak too much, as it made him restless, and he
would struggle with it in his dreams.</p>

<p>It was worst when he imagined himself on the old
farm; pitiful to see how he fought against the sea's
greedy advance, clutching the bedclothes with his
wasted fingers. It was a wearisome leave-taking with
existence, as wearisome as existence itself had been to
him.</p>

<p>One day when Maren had been to the village shop,
Ditte ran out screaming, as she came back. "Grandad's
dead!" she burst out sobbing. Sören lay bruised
and senseless across the doorstep to the kitchen. He
had been up on the big chest, meddling with the hands
of the clock. Maren dragged him to bed and bathed
his wounds, and when it was done he lay quietly following
her movements with his eyes. Now and then he
would ask in a low voice what the time was, and from
this Maren knew that he was nearing his end.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day he died he was altogether
changed again. It was as if he had come home to take
a last farewell of everybody and everything; he was
weak but quite in his senses. There was so much he
wanted to touch upon once again. His talk jumped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
from one thing to another and he seemed quite happy.
For the first time for many months he could sit on the
edge of the bed drinking his morning coffee, chatting to
Maren whenever she came near. He was exactly like a
big child, and Maren could not but put his old head
to hers and caress it. "You've worn well, Sören,"
said she, stroking his hair&mdash;"your hair's as soft as
when we were young."</p>

<p>Sören fell back, and lay with her hand in his, gazing
silently at her with worship in his faded eyes. "Maren,
would you let down your hair for me?" he whispered
bashfully at last. The words came with some difficulty.</p>

<p>"Nay, but what nonsense!" said Maren, hiding her
face against his chest; "we're old now, you know,
dear."</p>

<p>"Let down your hair for me!" whispered he, persisting,
and tried with shaking fingers to loosen it himself.
Maren remembered an evening long ago, an
evening behind a drawn-up boat on the beach, and with
sobs she loosened her gray hair and let it fall down over
Sören's head, so that it hid their faces. "It's long and
thick," he whispered softly, "enough to hide us both."
The words came as an echo from their bygone youth.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," said Maren, crying, "it's gray and thin
and rough. But how fond you were of it once."</p>

<p>With closed eyes Sören lay holding Maren's hand.
There was much to do in the kitchen, and she tried
again and again to draw her hand away, but he opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
his eyes each time, so she sat down, letting the things
look after themselves, and there she was with the
tears running down her furrowed face, while her
thoughts ran on. She and Sören had <a class="corr" name="TC_2" id="TC_2" title="live">lived</a> happily
together; they had had their quarrels, but if anything
serious happened, they always faced it together; neither
of them had lived and worked for themselves only. It
was so strange that they were now to be separated,
Maren could not understand it. Why could they not
be taken together? Where Sören went, Maren felt she
too should be. Perhaps in the place where he was
going he needed no one to mend his clothes and to
see that he kept his feet dry, but at least they might
have walked hand in hand in the Garden of Eden.
They had often talked about going into the country
to see what was hidden behind the big forest. But it
never came to anything, as one thing or another always
kept Maren at home. How beautiful it would have
been to go with Sören now; Maren would willingly have
made the journey with him, to see what was on the
other side&mdash;had it not been for Ditte. A child had
always kept her back, and thus it was now. Maren's
own time was not yet; she must wait, letting Sören go
alone.</p>

<p>Sören now slept more quietly, and she drew her
hand gently out of his. But as soon as she rose, he
opened his eyes, gazing at Maren's loosened hair and
tear-stained face.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Maren," said he, "you and Ditte'll get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
on all right. But do this for me, put up your hair as
you did at our wedding, will you, Maren?"</p>

<p>"But I can't do it myself, Sören," answered the old
woman, overwhelmed and beginning to cry again. But
Sören held to his point.</p>

<p>Then Maren gave in, and as she could not leave
Sören alone for long, she ran as fast as she could to the
hamlet, where one of the women dressed her thin gray
hair in bridal fashion. On her return she found Sören
restless, but he soon calmed down; he looked at her a
long time, as she sat crying by the bed with his hand
in hers. He was breathing with much difficulty.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he spoke in a stronger voice than he
had done for many days.</p>

<p>"We've shared good and bad together, Maren&mdash;and
now it's over. Will you be true to me for the
time you have left?" He rose on his elbow, looking
earnestly into her face.</p>

<p>Maren dried her bleared eyes, and looked faithfully
into his. "Ay," she said slowly and firmly&mdash;"no one
else has ever been in my thought nor ever shall be.
'Tis Christ Himself I take as a witness, you can trust
me, Sören."</p>

<p>Sören then fell back with closed eyes, and after a
while his hand slipped out of hers.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_VII" id="I_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
The Widow And The Fatherless</span></h2>


<p>After Sören's death there were hard days in
store for the two in the hut on the Naze.
Feeble as he had been, yet he had always
earned something, and had indeed been their sheet
anchor. They were now alone, with no man to work
for them. Not only had Maren to make things go as
far as possible, but she had to find the money as well.
This was a task she had never done before.</p>

<p>All they had once received for their share in the
boat and its fittings had gone too; and the funeral took
what was left. Their affairs could be settled by every
one, and at the time of Sören's death there was much
multiplying and subtracting in the homes round about
on Maren's behalf. But to one question there was no
answer; what had become of the two hundred crowns
paid for Ditte for once and for all? Ay, where had
they gone? The two old people had bought nothing
new at that time, and Sören had firmly refused to invest
in a new kind of fishing-net&mdash;an invention tried in other
places and said to be a great success. Indeed, there
were cases where the net had paid for itself in a single
night. However, Sören would not, and as so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
money never came twice to the hamlet in one generation,
they carried on with their old implements as usual.</p>

<p>The money had certainly not been used, nor had it
been eaten up, that was understood. The two old folk
had lived exactly as before, and it would have been
known if the money had gone up through the chimney.
There was no other explanation, than that Maren had
put it by; probably as something for Ditte to fall back
upon, when the two old ones had gone.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of talking in the homes,
mostly of how Maren and Ditte were to live. But with
that, their interest stopped. She had grown-up children
of her own, who were her nearest, and ought to
look after her affairs. One or two of them turned up
at the funeral, more to see if there was anything to be
had, and as soon as Sören was well underground they
left, practically vanishing without leaving a trace, and
with no invitation to Maren, who indeed hardly found
out where they lived. Well, Maren was not sorry to
see the last of them. She knew, in some measure, the
object of her children's homecoming; and for all she
cared they might never tread that way again&mdash;if only
she might keep Ditte. Henceforth they were the only
two in the world.</p>

<p>"They might at least have given you a helping
hand," said the women of the hamlet&mdash;"after all,
you're their mother."</p>

<p>"Nay, why so," said Maren. They had used her as
a pathway to existence&mdash;and it had not always been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
easy; perhaps they did not thank her for their being
here on earth, since they thought they owed her nothing.
One mother can care for eight children if necessary, but
has any one ever heard of eight children caring for
one mother? No, Maren was thankful they kept away,
and did not come poking round their old home.</p>

<p>She tried to sell the hut and the allotment in order to
provide means, but as no buyers offered for either, she
let the hut to a workman and his family, only keeping
one room and an end of the kitchen for herself. After
settling this she studded her own and the child's wooden
shoes with heavy nails. She brought forth Sören's
old stick, wrapped herself and the little one well up&mdash;and
wandered out into the country.</p>

<p>Day after day, in all weathers, they would set out in
the early morning, visiting huts and farms. Maren
knew fairly well for whom Sören had worked, and it
was quite time they paid their debts. She never asked
directly for the money, but would stand just inside the
door with the child in front of her, rattling a big leather
purse such as fisher folk used, and drone:</p>

<p>"God bless your work and your food&mdash;one and
all for sure! Times is hard&mdash;ay, money's scarce&mdash;ay,
'tis dear to live, and folks get old! And all's to be
bought&mdash;fat and meat and bread, ay, every scrap!&mdash;faith,
an old wife needs the money!"</p>

<p>Although Maren only asked for what was her due,
it was called begging, when she went on this errand, and
she and the child were treated accordingly. They often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
stood waiting in the scullery or just inside the living
room, while every one ran to and fro to their work
without appearing to notice them. People must be
taught their proper place, and nothing is so good as
letting them stand waiting, and that without any reason.
If they are not crushed by this, something must be
wrong.</p>

<p>Maren felt the slight, and the smart went deep; but
in no way shook her purpose&mdash;inwardly she was furious,
though too wise to show it, and, old as she was,
quietly added experience to experience. Perhaps after
all it was the child who made it easier for her to submit
to circumstances. So that was how she was treated
when she needed help! But when they themselves
needed help, it was a different matter; they were not
too proud to ask <i>her</i> advice. Then they would hurry
down to her, often in the middle of the night, knocking
at the window with the handle of a whip; she <i>must</i>
come, and that at once.</p>

<p>Maren was not stupid, and could perfectly well put
two and two together, only neglecting what she had no
use for. As long as Sören was by her side and held the
reins, she had kept in the background, knowing that
one master in the house was quite enough; and only on
special occasions&mdash;when something of importance was
at stake&mdash;would she lend a guiding hand, preferably
so unostentatiously that Sören never noticed it.</p>

<p>Blockhead, he used to call her&mdash;right up to his
illness. About a week before his death they had spoken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of the future, and Sören had comforted Maren by saying:
"'Twill all be right for you, Maren&mdash;if but you
weren't such a blockhead."</p>

<p>For the first time Maren had protested against this,
and Sören, as was his wont, referred to the case of
Sörine: "Ay, and did you see what was wrong with
the girl, what all saw who set eyes on her? And was
it not yourself that fed her with soft soap and paraffin?"</p>

<p>"Maybe 'twas," answered Maren, unmoved.</p>

<p>Sören looked at her with surprise: well to be sure&mdash;but
behind her look of innocence gleamed something
which staggered him for once. "Ay, ay," said he.
"Ay, ay! 'twas nigh jail that time."</p>

<p>Maren good-naturedly blinked her heavy eyelids.
"'Tis too good some folks are to be put there,"
answered she.</p>

<p>Sören felt as if cold water were running down his
back; here had he lived with Maren by his side for
forty-five years, and never taken her for anything else
but a good-natured blockhead&mdash;and he had nearly gone
to his grave with that opinion. And perhaps after all it
was she who had mastered him, and that by seeming a
fool herself.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_VIII" id="I_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
Wise Maren</span></h2>


<p>The heavy waves crashed on the shore. Large
wet flakes of snow hurled themselves on bushes
and grass; what was not caught by the high cliffs
was frozen to ice in the air and chased before the
storm.</p>

<p>The sea was foaming. The skies were all one great
dark gray whirl, with the roaring breakers beneath.
It was as if the abyss itself threw out its inexhaustible
flood of cold and wickedness. Endlessly it mounted
from the great deep; dense to battle against, and as
fire of hell to breathe.</p>

<p>Two clumsy figures worked their way forward over
the sandhills, an old grandmother holding a little girl
by the hand. They were so muffled up, that they
could hardly be distinguished in the thick haze.</p>

<p>Their movements were followed by watchful eyes, in
the huts on the hills women stood with faces pressed
flat against the window-panes! "'Tis wise Maren
battling against the storm," they told the old and the
sick within. And all who could, crawled to the window.
They must see for themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis proper weather for witches to be out," said
youth, and laughed. "But where is her broomstick?"</p>

<p>The old ones shook their heads. Maren ought not
to be made fun of; she had the <i>Gift</i> and did much good.
Maybe that once or twice she had misused her talents&mdash;but
who would not have done the same in her place?
On a day like this she would be full of power; it would
have been wise to consult her.</p>

<p>The two outside kept to the path that ran along the
edge of the steep cliff, hollowed out in many places by
the sea. Beneath them thundered the surf, water and
air and sand in one yellow ferment, and over it seagulls
and other sea birds, shrieking and whipping the
air with their wings. When a wave broke they would
swoop down and come up again with food in their
beaks&mdash;some fish left stunned by the waves to roll about
in the foam.</p>

<p>It seemed foolish of the two keeping just inside the
edge of the cliff, against which the storm was throwing
itself with all its might, to fall down well inland. The
old woman and the child clung to each other, gasping
for breath.</p>

<p>At one place the path went through a thicket of
thorns, bent inland by the strong sea wind, and here
they took shelter from the storm to regain their breath.
Ditte whimpered, she was tired and hungry.</p>

<p>"Be a big girl," said the old one, "we'll soon be
home now." She drew the child towards her under
the shawl, with shaking hands brushing the snow from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
her hair, and blowing her frozen fingers. "Ay, just
big," she said encouragingly, "and you'll get cakes
and nice hot coffee when we get home. I've the coffee
beans in the bag&mdash;ah, just smell!"</p>

<p>Granny opened the bag, which she had fastened
round her waist underneath her shawl. Into it went
all that she was given, food and other odds and ends.</p>

<p>The little one poked her nose down into the bag,
but was not comforted at once.</p>

<p>"We've nothing to warm it with," said she sulkily.</p>

<p>"And haven't we then? Granny was on the beach
last night, and saw the old boat, she did. But Ditte
was in the land of Nod, and never knew."</p>

<p>"Is there more firewood?"</p>

<p>"Hush, child, the coastguard might hear us. He's
long ears&mdash;and the Magistrate pays him for keeping
poor folks from getting warm. That's why he himself
takes all that's washed ashore."</p>

<p>"But you're not frightened of him, Granny, you're
a witch and can send him away."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, of course Granny can&mdash;and more too, if he
doesn't behave. She'll strike him down with rheumatism,
so that he can't move, and have to send for wise
Maren to rub his back. Ah me, old Granny's legs are
full of water, and aches and pains in every limb; a
horrid witch they call her, ay&mdash;and a thieving woman
too! But there must be some of both when an old
worn woman has to feed two mouths; and you may
be glad that Granny's the witch she is. None but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
cares for you&mdash;and lazy, no folks shall ever call her
that. She's two-and-seventy years now, and 'tis for
others her hands have toiled all along. But never a
hand that's lifted to help old Maren."</p>

<p>They sat well sheltered, and soon Ditte became
sleepy, and they started out again. "We'll fall asleep
if we don't, and then the black man'll come and take
us," said Granny as she tied her shawl round the little
one.</p>

<p>"Who's the black man?" Ditte stopped, clinging to
her grandmother from very excitement.</p>

<p>"The black man lives in the churchyard under the
ground. 'Tis he who lets out the graves to the dead
folks, and he likes to have a full house."</p>

<p>Ditte had no wish to go down and live with a black
man, and tripped briskly along hand in hand with the
old one. The path now ran straight inland, and the
wind was at their back&mdash;the storm had abated somewhat.</p>

<p>When they came to the Sand farm, she refused to go
further. "Let's go in there and ask for something,"
said she, dragging her grandmother. "I'm so hungry."</p>

<p>"Lord&mdash;are you mad, child! We daren't set foot
inside there."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go alone," declared Ditte firmly. She
let go her granny's hand and ran towards the entrance.
When there, however, she hesitated. "And why
daren't we go in there?" she shouted back.</p>

<p>Maren came and took her hand again: "Because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
your own father might come and drive us away with a
whip," said she slowly. "Come now and be a good
girl."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of him?" asked the little one persistently.
She was not accustomed to seeing her granny
turned aside for anything.</p>

<p>Afraid, indeed no&mdash;the times were too bad for that!
Poor people must be prepared to face all evils and
accept them too. And why should they go out of their
way to avoid the Sand farm as if it were holy ground.
If he did not care to take the chance of seeing his own
offspring occasionally, he could move his farm elsewhere.
They two had done nothing to be shamed into
running away, that was true enough. Perhaps there
was some ulterior motive behind the child's obstinacy?
Maren was not the one to oppose Providence&mdash;still less
if it lent her a helping hand.</p>

<p>"Well, come then!" said she, pushing the gate
open. "They can but eat us."</p>

<p>They went through the deep porch which served
as wood and tool house as well. At one side turf was
piled neatly up right to the beams. Apparently they
had no thought of being cold throughout the winter.
Maren looked at the familiar surroundings as they
crossed the yard towards the scullery. Once in her
young days she had been in service here&mdash;for the sake
of being nearer the home of her childhood and Sören.
It was some years ago, that! The grandfather of the
present young farmer reigned then&mdash;a real Tartar who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
begrudged his servant both food and sleep. But he
made money! The old farmer, who died about the
same time as Sören, was young then, and went with
stocking feet under the servants' windows! He and
Sören cared nought for each other! Maren had
not been here since&mdash;Sören would not allow it.
And he himself never set foot inside, since that
dreary visit about Sörine. A promise was a
promise.</p>

<p>But now it was <i>so</i> long ago, and two hundred crowns
could not last forever. Sören was dead, and Maren
saw things differently in her old days. Cold and hardship
raised her passion, as never before, against those
sitting sheltered inside, who had no need to go hunting
about like a dog in all weathers, and against those who
for a short-lived joy threw years of heavy burden on
poor old shoulders. Why had she waited so long in
presenting his offspring to the farmer? Perhaps they
were longing for it. And why should not the little
one have her own way? Perhaps it was the will of
Providence, speaking through her, in her obstinate
desire to enter her father's house.</p>

<p>All the same, Maren's conscience was not quite clear
while standing with Ditte beside her, waiting for some
one to come. The farmer apparently was out, and for
that she was thankful. She could hear the servant milking
in the shed, they would hardly have a man at this
time of the year.</p>

<p>The cracked millstone still lay in front of the door,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and in the middle of the floor was a large flat tombstone
with ornaments in the corners, the inscription quite
worn away.</p>

<p>A young woman came from the inner rooms. Maren
had not seen her before. She was better dressed than
the young wives of the neighborhood, and had a kind
face and gentle manners. She asked them into the
living room, took off their shawls, which she hung by
the fire to dry. She then made them sit down and gave
them food and drink, speaking kindly to them all the
while; to Ditte in particular, which softened Maren's
heart.</p>

<p>"And where do you come from?" asked she, seating
herself beside them.</p>

<p>"Ay, where do folk come from?" answered Maren
mumblingly. "Where's there room for poor people
like us? Some have plenty&mdash;and for all that go where
they have no right to be; others the Lord's given
naught but a corner in the churchyard. But you don't
belong to these parts, since you ask."</p>

<p>No, the young woman came from Falster; her voice
grew tender as she spoke of her birthplace.</p>

<p>"Is't far from here?" said Maren, glancing at her.</p>

<p>"Yes, it takes a whole day by train and by coach, and
from the town too!"</p>

<p>"Has it come to that, that the men of the Sand
farm must travel by train to find wives for themselves?
But the hamlet is good enough for sweethearts."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>The young woman looked uncertainly at her. "We
met each other at the Continuation School," said she.</p>

<p>"Well, well, has he been to Continuation School
too? Ay, 'tis fine all must be nowadays. Anyway,
'twas time he got settled."</p>

<p>The young woman flushed. "You speak so
strangely," said she.</p>

<p>"Belike you'll tell me how an old wife should speak?
'Tis strange indeed that a father sits sheltered at home
while his little one runs barefoot and begs."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" whispered the young woman
anxiously!</p>

<p>"What the Lord and every one knows, but no-one's
told you. Look you at the child <i>there</i>&mdash;faces don't tell
lies, she's the image of her father. If all was fair,
'twould be my daughter sitting here in your stead&mdash;ay,
and no hunger and cold for me."</p>

<p>As she spoke, Maren sucked a ham bone. She had
no teeth, and the fat ran down over her chin and
hands.</p>

<p>The young woman took out her handkerchief.
"Let me help you, mother," said she, gently drying
her face. She was white to the lips, and her hands
shook.</p>

<p>Maren allowed herself to be cared for. Her sunken
mouth was set and hard. Suddenly she grasped the
young woman by the hips with her earth-stained hands.
"'Tis light and pure!" she mumbled, making signs
over her. "In childbirth 'twill go badly with you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
The woman swayed in her hands and fell to the ground
without a sound; little Ditte began to scream.</p>

<p>Maren was so terrified by the consequence of her
act, that she never thought of offering help. She tore
down the shawls from the fire and ran out, dragging
the child after her. It was not until they reached the
last house in the hamlet, the lifeboat shed, that she
stopped to wrap themselves up.</p>

<p>Ditte still shook. "Did you kill her?" asked she.</p>

<p>The old woman started, alarmed at the word. "Nay,
but of course not. 'Tis nothing to prate about: come
along home," said she harshly, pushing the child. Ditte
was unaccustomed to be spoken to in this manner, and
she hurried along.</p>

<p>The house was cold as they entered it, and Maren put
the little one straight to bed. Then having gathered
sticks for the fire, she put on water for the coffee,
talking to herself all the while. "Ugh, just so; but
who's to blame? The innocent must suffer, to make
the guilty speak."</p>

<p>"What did you say, Granny?" asked Ditte from
the alcove.</p>

<p>"'Twas only I'm thinking your father'll soon find
his way down here after this."</p>

<p>A trap came hurrying through the dark and stopped
outside. In burst the owner of the Sand farm. There
was no good in store for them; his face was red with
anger and he started abusing them almost before he got
inside the door. Maren had her head well wrapped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
up against the cold, and pretended to hear nothing.
"Well, well, you're a sight for sore eyes," said she,
smilingly inviting him in.</p>

<p>"Don't suppose that I've come to make a fuss of
you, you crafty old hag!" stormed Anders Olsen in his
thin cracked voice. "No, I've come to fetch you, I
have, and that at once. So you'd better come!" seizing
her by the arm.</p>

<p>Maren wrenched herself out of his grasp. "What's
wrong with you?" asked she, staring at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Wrong with me?&mdash;you dare to ask that, you old
witch, you. Haven't you been up to the farm this
afternoon&mdash;dragging the brat with you? though you
were bought and paid to keep off the premises. Made
trouble you have, you old hag, and bewitched my wife,
so she's dazed with pain. But I'll drag you to justice
and have you burned at the stake, you old devil!"
He foamed at the mouth and shook his clenched fist in
her face.</p>

<p>"So you order folks to be burnt, do you?" said
Maren scornfully. "Then you'd best light up and
stoke up for yourself as well. Seemingly you've taken
more on your back than you can carry."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" hissed the farmer,
gesticulating, as if prepared at any moment to pounce
upon Maren and drag her to the trap. "Maybe it's a
lie, that you've been to the farm and scared my wife?"
He went threateningly round her, but without touching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
her. "What have you to do with my back?" shouted
he loudly, with fear in his eyes. "D'you want to bewitch
me too, what?"</p>

<p>"'Tis nothing with your back I've to do, or yourself
either. But all can see that the miser's cake'll be eaten,
ay, even by crow and raven if need be. Keep your
strength for your young wife&mdash;you might overstrain
yourself on an old witch like me. And where'd she be
then, eh?"</p>

<p>Anders Olsen had come with the intention of throwing
the old witch into the trap and taking her home with
him&mdash;by fair means or foul&mdash;so that she could undo her
magic on the spot. And there he sat on the woodbox,
his cap between his hands, a pitiful sight. Maren
had judged him aright, there was nothing manly about
him, he fought with words instead of fists. The men
of the Sand farm were a poor breed, petty and grasping.
This one was already bald, the muscles of his
neck stood sharply out, and his mouth was like a tightly
shut purse. It was no enviable position to be his wife;
the miser was already uppermost in him! Already he
was shivering with cold down his back&mdash;having forgotten
his fear for his wife in his thought for himself.</p>

<p>Maren put a cup of coffee on the kitchen table, then
sat down herself on the steps leading to the attic with
a cracked cup between her fingers. "Just you drink
it up," said she, as he hesitated&mdash;"there's no-one here
that'll harm you and yours."</p>

<p>"But you've been home and made mischief," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
mumbled, stretching out his hand for the cup; he seemed
equally afraid of drinking or leaving the coffee.</p>

<p>"We've been at the farm we two, 'tis true enough.
The bad storm drove us in, 'twas sore against our
will." Maren spoke placidly and with forbearance.
"And as to your wife, belike it made her ill, and
couldn't bear to hear what a man she's got. A kind and
good woman she is&mdash;miles too good for you. She gave
us nought but the best, while you're just longing to burn
us. Ay, ay, 'twould be plenty warm enough then!
For here 'tis cold, and there's no-one to bring a load
of peat to the house."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd like <i>me</i> to bring you a load?"
snapped the farmer, closing his mouth like a trap.</p>

<p>"The child's yours for all that; she's cold and
hungry, work as I may."</p>

<p>"Well, she was paid for once and for all."</p>

<p>"Ay, 'twas easy enough for you! Let your own
offspring want; 'tis the only child, we'll hope, the Lord'll
trust you with."</p>

<p>The farmer started, as if awakened to his senses.
"Cast off your spell from my wife!" he shouted, striking
the table with his hands.</p>

<p>"I've nought against your wife. But just you see, if
the Lord'll put a child in your care. 'Tis not likely to
me."</p>

<p>"You leave the Lord alone&mdash;and cast off the spell,"
he whispered hoarsely, making for the old woman,
"or I'll throttle you, old witch that you are." He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
gray in the face, and his thin, crooked fingers clutched
the air.</p>

<p>"Have a care, your own child lies abed and can hear
you." Maren pushed open the door to the inner room.
"D'you hear that, Ditte, your father's going to throttle
me."</p>

<p>Anders Olsen turned away from her and went
towards the door. He stood a moment fumbling with
the door handle, as if not knowing what he did; then
came back, and sank down on the woodbox, gazing at
the clay floor. He looked uncommonly old and had
always done so ever since his childhood, it was said
people of the Sand farm were always born toothless.</p>

<p>Maren came and placed herself in front of him.
"Maybe you're thinking of the son your wife should
bear? And maybe seeing him already running by your
side in the fields, just like a little foal, and learning
to hold the plow. Ay! many a one's no son to save
for, but enjoys putting by for all that. And often 'tis
a close-fisted father has a spendthrift son; belike 'tis
the Lord punishing them for their greedy ways. You
may fight on till you break up&mdash;like many another one.
Or sell the farm to strangers, when there's no more
work in you&mdash;and shift in to the town to a fine little
house! For folks with money there's many a way!"</p>

<p>The farmer lifted his head. "Cast off your spell
from my wife," he said beseechingly, "and I'll make it
worth your while."</p>

<p>"On the Sand farm we'll never set foot again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
neither me nor the child. But you can send your wife
down here&mdash;'tis no harm she'll come to, but don't forget
if good's to come of it, on a load of peat she must
ride!"</p>

<p>Early next morning the pretty young wife from the
Sand farm, could be seen driving through the hamlet
seated on top of a swinging cartload of peat. Apparently
the farmer did not care to be seen with his
wife like this, for he himself was not there; a lad drove
the cart. Many wondered where they were going,
and with their faces against the window-panes watched
them pass. From one or another hut, with no outlook,
a woman would come throwing a shawl over her head as
she hurried towards the Naze. As the lad carried the
peat into Maren's woodshed, and the farmer's wife
unpacked eggs, ham, cakes, butter and many other
good things on the table in the little sitting room, they
came streaming past, staring through the window&mdash;visiting
the people in the other part of the house with
one or other foolish excuse. Maren knew quite well
why they came, but it did not worry her any longer.
She was accustomed to people keeping an eye on her
and using her neighbors as a spying ground.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards the news ran round the
neighborhood that the farmer had begun to take notice
of his illegitimate child&mdash;not altogether with a good
will perhaps. Maren was supposed to have had a
hand in the arrangement. No-one understood her long
patience with him; especially as she had right on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
side. But now it would seem she had tired of it and
had begun casting spells over the farmer's young wife&mdash;first
charmed a child into her, and then away again,
according to her will. Some declared Ditte was used
for this purpose&mdash;by conjuring her backwards, right
back to her unborn days, so that the child was obliged
to seek a mother, and it was because of this she never
grew properly. Ditte was extraordinarily small for her
age, for all she was never really ill. Probably she
was not allowed to grow as she should do, or she
would be too big to will away to nothing.</p>

<p>There was much to be said both for and against
having such as wise Maren in the district. That she
was a witch was well known; but as they went she was
in the main a good woman. She never used her talents
in the service of the Devil, that is as far as any one
knew&mdash;and she was kind to the poor; curing many a
one without taking payment for it. And as to the
farmer of the Sand farm, he only got what he deserved.</p>

<p>Maren's fame was established after this. People
have short memories, when it is to their own advantage,
and Anders Olsen was seldom generous to them. There
would be long intervals in between his visits, then suddenly
he would take to coming often. The men of
the Sand farm had always been plagued by witchcraft.
They might be working in the fields, and bending down
to pick up a stone or a weed, when all of a sudden
some unseen deviltry would strike them with such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
excruciating pains in the back, that they could not
straighten themselves, and had to crawl home on all
fours. There they would lie groaning for weeks, suffering
greatly from doing nothing, and treated by cupping,
leeches and good advice, till one day the pain
would disappear as quickly as it had come. They themselves
put it down to the evil eye of women, who
perhaps felt themselves ignored and took their revenge
in this mean fashion; others thought it was a punishment
from Heaven for having too fat a back. At all
events this was their weak spot, and whenever the
farmer felt a twinge of pain in his back he would hurry
to propitiate wise Maren.</p>

<p>This was not sufficient to live on, but her fame
increased, and with it her circle of patients.</p>

<p>Maren herself never understood why she had become
so famous; but she accepted the fact as it was,
and turned it to the best account she could. She took
up one thing or another of what she remembered from
her childhood of her mother's good advice&mdash;and left
the rest to look after itself; generally she was guided
by circumstances as to what to say and do.</p>

<p>Maren had heard so often that she was a witch,
and occasionally believed it herself. Other times she
would marvel at people's stupidity. But she always
thought with a sigh of the days when Sören still lived
and she was nothing more than his "blockhead"&mdash;those
were happy days.</p>

<p>Now she was lonely. Sören lay under the ground,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and every one else avoided her like the plague, when
they did not require her services. Others met and
enjoyed a gossip, but no one thought of running in to
Maren for a cup of coffee. Even her neighbors kept
themselves carefully away, though they often required
a helping hand and got it too. She had but one living
friend, who looked to her with confidence and who was
not afraid of her&mdash;Ditte.</p>

<p>It was a sad and sorry task to be a wise woman&mdash;only
more so as it was not her own choice; but it gave
her a livelihood.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_IX" id="I_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
Ditte Visits Fairyland</span></h2>


<p>Ditte was now big enough to venture out alone,
and would often run away from home, without
making Maren uneasy. She needed some one to
play with, and sought for playmates in the hamlet and
the huts at the edge of the forest. But the parents
would call their children in when they saw her coming.
Eventually the children themselves learned to beware
of her; they would throw stones at her when she came
near, and shout nicknames: bastard and witch's brat.
Then she tried children in other places and met the
same fate; at last it dawned upon her that she stood
apart. She was not even sure of the children at home;
just as she was playing with them on the sandhills, making
necklaces and rings of small blue scabious, the
mother would run out and tear the children away.</p>

<p>She had to learn to play alone and be content with
the society of the things around her; which she did.
Ditte quickly invested her playthings with life; sticks
and stones were all given a part and they were wonderfully
easy to manage. Almost too well behaved, and
Ditte herself sometimes had to put a little naughtiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
into them; or they would be too dull. There was an
old wornout wooden shoe of Sören's; Maren had
painted a face on it and given it an old shawl as a
dress. In Ditte's world it took the part of a boy&mdash;a
rascal of a boy&mdash;always up to mischief and in some
scrape or other. It was constantly breaking things, and
every minute Ditte had to punish it and give it a good
whipping.</p>

<p>One day she was sitting outside in the sun busily
engaged in scolding this naughty boy of a doll, in a voice
deep with motherly sorrow and annoyance. Maren,
who stood inside the kitchen door cleaning herrings,
listened with amusement. "If you do it once more,"
said the child, "we'll take you up to the old witch, and
she'll eat you all up."</p>

<p>Maren came quickly out. "Who says that?" asked
she, her furrowed face quivering.</p>

<p>"The Bogie-man says it," said Ditte cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Rubbish, child, be serious. Who's taught you that?
Tell me at once."</p>

<p>Ditte tried hard to be solemn. "Bogie-doggie said
it&mdash;tomorrow!" bubbling over with mirth.</p>

<p>No-one could get the better of her; she was bored,
and just invented any nonsense that came into her head.
Maren gave it up and returned to her work quietly and
in deep thought.</p>

<p>She stood crying over her herrings, with the salt
tears dropping down into the pickle. She often cried
of late, over herself and over the world in general; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
people treated her as if she were infected with the
plague, poisoning the air round her with their meanness
and hate, while as far as she knew she had always
helped them to the best of her ability. They did not
hesitate in asking her advice when in trouble, though at
the same time they would blame <i>her</i> for having brought
it upon them&mdash;calling her every name they could think
of when she had gone. Even the child's <i>innocent</i> lips
called her a witch.</p>

<p>Since Sören's death sorrow and tears had reddened
Maren's eyes with inflammation and turned her eyelids,
but her neighbors only took it as another sign of her
hardened witchcraft. Her sight was failing too, and
she often had to depend upon Ditte's young eyes; and
then it would happen that the child took advantage of
the opportunity and played pranks.</p>

<p>Ditte was not bad&mdash;she was neither bad nor good.
She was simply a little creature, whose temperament required
change. And so little happened in her world,
that she seized on whatever offered to prevent herself
from being bored to death.</p>

<p>One day something did happen! From one of the
big farms, lying at the other side of the common, with
woods bounding the sandhills, Maren had received
permission to gather sticks in the wood every Tuesday.
There was not much heat in them, but they were good
enough for making a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>These Tuesdays were made into picnics. They took
their meals with them, which they enjoyed in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
pleasant spot, preferably by the edge of the lake, and
Ditte would sit on the wheelbarrow on both journeys.
When they had got their load, they would pick berries
or&mdash;in the autumn&mdash;crab-apples and sloes, which were
afterwards cooked in the oven.</p>

<p>Now Granny was ill, having cried so much that she
could no longer see&mdash;which Ditte quite understood&mdash;but
the extraordinary part of it was that the water
seemed to have gone to her legs, so that she could not
stand on them. The little one had to trudge all alone
to the forest for the sticks. It was a long way, but to
make up for it, the forest was full of interest. Now
she could go right in, where otherwise she was not
allowed to go, because Granny was afraid of getting
lost, and always kept to the outskirts. There were
singing birds in there, their twittering sounded wonderful
under the green trees, the air was like
green water with rays of light in it, and it
hummed and seethed in the darkness under the
bushes.</p>

<p>Ditte was not afraid, though it must be admitted she
occasionally shivered. Every other minute she stopped
to listen, and when a dry stick snapped, she started,
thrilled with excitement. She was not bored here, her
little body was brimming over with the wonder of it;
each step brought her fresh experiences full of unknown
solemnity. Suddenly it would jump out at her with a
frightful: pshaw!&mdash;exactly as the fire did when Granny
poured paraffin over it&mdash;and she would hurry away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
as quickly as her small feet would carry her, until she
came to an opening in the wood.</p>

<p>On one of these flights she came to a wide river, with
trees bending over it. It was like a wide stream of
greenness flowing down, and Ditte stood transfixed, in
breathless wonder. The green of the river she quickly
grasped, for this was the color poured down on all
trees&mdash;and the river here was the end of the world.
Over on the other side the Lord lived; if she looked
very hard she could just catch a glimpse of his gray
bearded face in a thicket of thorns. But how was all
this greenness made?</p>

<p>She ran for some distance along the edge of the river,
watching it, until she was stopped by two ladies, so
beautiful that she had never seen anything like them
before. Though there was no rain, and they were
walking under the trees in the shadow, they held parasols,
on which the sun gleamed through the green leaves,
looking like glowing coins raining down on to their
parasols. They kneeled in front of Ditte as if she were
a little princess, lifting her bare feet and peeping under
the soles, as they questioned her.</p>

<p>Well, her name was Ditte. Ditte Mischief and
Ditte Goodgirl&mdash;and Ditte child o' Man!</p>

<p>The ladies looked at each other and laughed, and
asked her where she lived.</p>

<p>In Granny's house, of course.</p>

<p>"What Granny?" asked the stupid ladies again.</p>

<p>Ditte stamped her little bare foot on the grass:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Granny! that's blind sometimes 'cos she cries
so much. Ditte's own Granny."</p>

<p>Then they pretended to be much wiser, and asked her
to go home with them for a little while. Ditte gave
her little hand trustingly to one of them and trotted
along; she did not mind seeing if they lived on the
other side of the river&mdash;with the Lord. Then it would
be angels she had met.</p>

<p>They went along the river; Ditte, impatient with
excitement, thought it would never end. At last they
came to a footbridge, arched across the river. At the
end of the bridge was a barred gate with railings on
each side, which it was impossible to climb over or
under. The ladies opened the gate with a key and
carefully locked it again, and Ditte found herself in
a most beautiful garden. By the path stood
lovely flowers in clusters, red and blue, swaying
their pretty heads; and on low bushes were delicious
large red berries such as she had never tasted
before.</p>

<p>Ditte knew at once that this was Paradise. She
threw herself against one of the ladies, her mouth red
with the juice of the berries, looking up at her with an
unfathomable expression in her dark blue eyes and
said: "Am I dead now?"</p>

<p>The ladies laughed and took her into the house,
through beautiful rooms where one walked on thick
soft shawls with one's boots on. In the innermost room
a little lady was sitting in an armchair. She was white-haired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and wrinkled and had spectacles on her nose;
and wore a white nightcap in spite of it being the middle
of the day. "This is our Granny!" said one of the
ladies.</p>

<p>"Grandmother, look, we have caught a little wood
goblin," they shouted into the old lady's ear. Just
think, this Granny was deaf&mdash;her own was only
blind.</p>

<p>Ditte went round peeping inquisitively into the different
rooms. "Where's the Lord?" asked she suddenly.</p>

<p>"What is the child saying?" exclaimed one of the
ladies. But the one who had taken Ditte by the hand,
drew the little one towards her and said: "The Lord
does not live here, he lives up in Heaven. She thinks
this is Paradise," she added, turning to her sister.</p>

<p>It worried them to see her running about barefooted,
and they carefully examined her feet, fearing
she might have been bitten by some creeping thing in
the wood. "Why does not the child wear boots?"
said the old lady. Her head shook so funnily when
she spoke, all the white curls bobbed&mdash;just like bluebells.</p>

<p>Ditte had no boots.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! do you hear that, Grandmother,
the child has no boots. Have you nothing at all to put
on your feet?"</p>

<p>"Bogie-man," burst out Ditte, laughing roguishly.</p>

<p>She was tired now of answering all their questions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
However, they dragged out of her that she had a pair
of wooden shoes, which were being kept for winter.</p>

<p>"Then with the help of God she shall have a pair of
my cloth ones," said the old lady. "Give her a pair,
Asta; and take a fairly good pair."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Grandmother," answered one of the
young women&mdash;the one Ditte liked best.</p>

<p>So Ditte was put into the cloth boots. Then she
was given different kinds of food, such as she had never
tasted before, and did not care for either; she kept to
the bread, being most familiar with that&mdash;greatly to
the astonishment of the three women.</p>

<p>"She is fastidious," said one of the young ladies.</p>

<p>"It can hardly be called that, when she prefers bread
to anything else," answered Miss Asta eagerly. "But
she is evidently accustomed to very plain food, and yet
see how healthy she is." She drew the little one to her
and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Let her take it home with her," said the old lady,
"such children of nature never eat in captivity. My
husband once captured a little wild monkey down on
the Gold Coast, but was obliged to let it go again
because it refused to eat."</p>

<p>Then Ditte was given the food packed into a pretty
little basket of red and white straw; a Leghorn hat
was put upon her head, and a large red bow adorned
her breast. She enjoyed all this very much&mdash;but suddenly,
remembering her Granny, wanted to go home.
She stood pulling the door handle, and they had to let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
this amusing little wood goblin out again. Hurriedly
a few strawberries were put into the basket, and off
she disappeared into the wood.</p>

<p>"I hope she can find her way back again," said Miss
Asta looking after her with dreaming eyes.</p>

<p>Ditte certainly found her way home. It was fortunate
that in her longing to be there, she entirely forgot
what was in the basket. Otherwise old Maren
would have gone to her grave without ever having
tasted strawberries.</p>

<p>After that Ditte often ran deep into the forest, in
the hope that the adventure would repeat itself. It had
been a wonderful experience, the most wonderful in her
life. Old Maren encouraged her too. "You just go
right into the thicket," she said. "Naught can harm
you, for you're a Sunday child. And when you get
to the charmed house, you must ask for a pair of
cloth boots for me too. Say that old Granny has water
in her legs and can hardly bear shoes on her feet."</p>

<p>The river was easily found, but she did not meet
the beautiful ladies again, and the footbridge with the
gate had disappeared. There were woods on the
other side of the river just as on this, the Lord's face
she could no longer find either, look as she might;
Fairyland was no more.</p>

<p>"You'll see, 'twas naught but a dream," said old
Maren.</p>

<p>"But, Granny, the strawberries," answered Ditte.</p>

<p>Ay, the strawberries&mdash;that was true enough! Maren
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
had eaten some of them herself, and she had never
tasted anything so delicious either. Twenty times
bigger than wild strawberries, and satisfying too&mdash;so
unlike other berries, which only upset one.</p>

<p>"The dream goblin, who took you to Fairyland,
gave you those so that other folks might taste them
too," said the old one at last.</p>

<p>And with this explanation they were satisfied.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_X" id="I_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
Ditte Gets A Father</span></h2>


<p>On getting up one morning, Maren found her
tenants had gone, they had moved in the middle
of the night. "The Devil has been and fetched them,"
she said cheerfully. She was not at all sorry that they
had vanished; they were a sour and quarrelsome
family! But the worst of it was that they owed her
twelve weeks' rent&mdash;twelve crowns&mdash;which was all she
had to meet the winter with.</p>

<p>Maren put up a notice and waited for new tenants,
but none offered themselves; the old ones had spread
the rumor that the house was haunted.</p>

<p>Maren felt the loss of the rent so much more as she
had given up her profession. She would no longer be a
wise woman, it was impossible to bear the curse. "Go
to those who are wiser, and leave me in peace," she
answered, when they came for advice or to fetch her,
and they had to go away with their object unaccomplished,
and soon it was said that Maren had lost her
witchcraft.</p>

<p>Yes, her strength diminished, her sight was almost
gone, and her legs refused to carry her. She spun and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
knitted for people and took to begging again, Ditte
leading her from farm to farm. They were weary
journeys; the old woman always complaining and leaning
heavily on the child's shoulder. Ditte could not
understand it at all, the flowers in the ditches and a
hundred other things called her, she longed to shake
off the leaden arm and run about alone, Granny's everlasting
wailing filled her with a hopeless loathing. Then
a mischievous thought would seize her. "I can't find
the way, Granny," she would suddenly declare, refusing
to go a step further, or she would slip away, hiding
herself nearby. Maren scolded and threatened for
a while, but as it had no effect, she would sit down
on the edge of the ditch crying; this softened Ditte and
she would hurry back, putting her arms around her
grandmother's neck. Thus they cried together, in
sorrow over the miserable world and joy at having
found each other again.</p>

<p>A little way inland lived a baker, who gave them a
loaf of bread every week. The child was sent for it
when Maren was ill in bed. Ditte was hungry, and this
was a great temptation, so she always ran the whole
way home to keep the tempter at bay; when she succeeded
in bringing the bread back untouched, she and
her Granny were equally proud. But it sometimes happened
that the pangs of hunger were too strong, and
she would tear out the crump from the side of the warm
bread as she ran. It was not meant to be seen, and
for that reason she took it from the side of the bread&mdash;just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
a little, but before she knew what had happened
the whole loaf was hollowed out. Then she would be
furious, at herself and Granny and everything.</p>

<p>"Here's the bread, Granny," she would say in an
offhand voice, throwing the bread on the table.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear, is it new?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Granny," and Ditte disappeared.</p>

<p>Thereupon the old woman would sit gnawing the
crust with her sore gums, all the while grumbling at
the child. Wicked girl&mdash;she should be whipped. She
should be turned out, to the workhouse.</p>

<p>To their minds there was nothing worse than the
workhouse; in all their existence, it had been as a sword
over their heads, and when brought forth by Maren,
Ditte would come out from her hiding-place, crying
and begging for pardon. The old woman would cry
too, and the one would soothe the other, until both were
comforted.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, 'tis hard to live," old Maren would say.
"If you'd but had a father&mdash;one worth having. Maybe
you'd have got the thrashings all folks need, and poor
old Granny'd have lived with you instead of begging
her food!"</p>

<p>Maren had barely finished speaking, when a cart with
a bony old nag in the shafts stopped outside on the
road. A big stooping man with tousled hair and beard
sprang down from the cart, threw the reins over the
back of the nag, and came towards the house. He
looked like a coalheaver.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's selling herrings," said Ditte, who was kneeling
on a stool by the window. "Shall I let him in?"</p>

<p>"Ay, just open the door."</p>

<p>Ditte unbolted the door, and the man came staggering
in. He wore heavy wooden boots, into which his
trousers were pushed; and each step he took rang
through the room, which was too low for him to stand
upright in. He stood looking round just inside the
door; Ditte had taken refuge behind Granny's spinning
wheel. He came towards the living room, holding out
his hand.</p>

<p>Ditte burst into laughter at his confusion when the
old woman did not accept it. "Why, Granny's blind!"
she said, bubbling over with mirth.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it? Then it's hardly to be expected that
you could see," he said, taking the old woman's hand.
"Well, I'm your son-in-law, there's news for you."
His voice rang with good-humor.</p>

<p>Maren quickly raised her head. "Which of the girls
is it?" asked she.</p>

<p>"The mother of this young one," answered he, aiming
at Ditte with his big battered hat. "It's not what
you might call legal yet; we've done without the
parson till he's needed&mdash;so much comes afore that.
But a house and a home we've got, though poor it may
be. We live a good seven miles inland on the other
side of the common&mdash;on the <i>sand</i>&mdash;folks call it the
'Crow's Nest'!"</p>

<p>"And what's your name?" asked Maren again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lars Peter Hansen, I was christened."</p>

<p>The old woman considered for a while, then shook
her head. "I've never heard of you."</p>

<p>"My father was called the hangman. Maybe you
know me now?"</p>

<p>"Ay, 'tis a known name&mdash;if not of the best."</p>

<p>"Folks can't always choose their own names, or character
either, and must just be satisfied with a clear
conscience. But as I was passing I thought I'd just look
in and see you. When we're having the parson to give
us his blessing, Sörine and me, I'll come with the trap
and fetch the two of you to church. That's if you don't
care to move down to us at once&mdash;seems like that would
be best."</p>

<p>"Did Sörine send the message?" asked Maren suspiciously.</p>

<p>Lars Peter Hansen mumbled something, which
might be taken for either yes or no.</p>

<p>"Ay, I thought so, you hit on it yourself, and
thanks to you for your kindness; but we'd better stay
where we are. Though we'd like to go to the wedding.
'Tis eight children I've brought into the world, and nigh
all married now, but I've never been asked to a wedding
afore." Maren became thoughtful. "And
what's your trade?" she asked soon after.</p>

<p>"I hawk herrings&mdash;and anything else to be got. Buy
rags and bones too when folks have any."</p>

<p>"You can hardly make much at that&mdash;for folks wear
their rags as long as there's a thread left&mdash;and there's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
few better off than that. Or maybe they're more well-to-do
in other places?"</p>

<p>"Nay, 'tis the same there as here, clothes worn out
to the last thread, and bones used until they crumble,"
answered the man with a laugh. "But a living's to be
made."</p>

<p>"Ay, that's so, food's to be got from somewhere!
But you must be hungry? 'Tisn't much we've got to
offer you, though we can manage a cup of coffee, if
that's good enough&mdash;Ditte, run along to the baker and
tell him what you've done to the bread, and that we've
got company. Maybe he'll scold you and give you
another&mdash;if he doesn't, we'll have to go without next
week. But tell the truth. Hurry up now&mdash;and don't
pull out the crump."</p>

<p>With lingering feet Ditte went out of the door. It
was a hard punishment, and she hung back in the hope
that Granny would relent and let her off fetching the
bread. Pull out the crump&mdash;no, never again, today or
as long as she lived. Her ears burned with shame at
the thought that her new father should know her
misdeeds, the baker too would know what a wicked
girl she was to Granny. She would not tell an untruth,
for Granny always said to clear oneself with a lie was
like cutting thistles: cut off the head of one and half a
dozen will spring up in its place. Ditte knew from experience
that lies always came back on one with redoubled
trouble; consequently she had made up her
little mind, that it did not pay to avoid the truth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Lars Peter Hansen sat by the window gazing after
the child, who loitered along the road, and as she
suddenly began to run, he turned to the old woman,
asking: "Can you manage her?"</p>

<p>"Ay, she's good enough," said Maren from the
kitchen, fumbling with the sticks in trying to light the
fire. "I've no one better to lean on&mdash;and don't want it
either. But she's a child, and I'm old and troublesome&mdash;so
the one makes up for the other. The foal will
kick backwards, and the old horse will stand. But
'tis dull to spend one's childhood with one that's old and
weak and all."</p>

<p>Ditte was breathless when she reached the baker's,
so quickly had she run in order to get back as soon as
possible to the big stooping man with the good-natured
growl.</p>

<p>"Now I've got a father, just like other children,"
she shouted breathlessly. "He's at home with Granny&mdash;and
he's got a horse and cart."</p>

<p>"Nay, is that so?" said they, opening their eyes,
"and what's his name?"</p>

<p>"He's called the rag and bone man!" answered
Ditte proudly.</p>

<p>And they knew him here! Ditte saw them exchange
glances.</p>

<p>"Then you belong to a grand family," said the
baker's wife, laying the loaf of bread on the counter&mdash;without
realizing that the child had already had her
weekly loaf, so taken up was she with the news.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>And Ditte, who was even more so, seized the bread
and ran. Not until she was halfway home did she
remember what she ought to have confessed; it was
too late then.</p>

<p>Before Lars Peter Hansen left, he presented them
with a dozen herrings, and repeated his promise of
coming to fetch them to the wedding.</p>




<hr class="chapbreak" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_XI" id="I_CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
The New Father</span></h2>


<p>When Ditte was six months old, she had the bad
habit of putting things into her mouth&mdash;everything
went that way. This was the proof whether they
could be eaten or not.</p>

<p>Ditte laughed when Granny told about it, because
she was so much wiser now. There were things one
could not eat and yet get pleasure from, and other
things which could be eaten, but gave more enjoyment
if one left them alone, content in the thought of how
they would taste if&mdash;&mdash;Then one hugged oneself with
delight at keeping it so much longer. "You're foolish,"
said Granny, "eat it up before it goes bad!"
But Ditte understood how to put by. She would dream
over one or other thing she had got: a red apple, for
instance, she would press to her cheek and mouth and
kiss. Or she would hide it and go about thinking of it
with silent devotion. Should she return and find it
spoiled, well, in imagination she had eaten it over and
over again. This was beyond Granny; her helplessness
had made her greedy, and she could never get
enough to eat; now it was she who put everything into
her mouth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>But then they had watched the child, for fear she
should eat something which might harm her. More
so Sören. "Not into your mouth!" he often said.
Whereupon the child would gaze at him, take the thing
out of her own mouth and try to put it into his. Was it
an attempt to get an accomplice, or did the little one
think it was because he himself wanted to suck the
thing, that he forbade her? Sören was never quite
clear on this point.</p>

<p>At all events, Ditte had learned at an early age to
reckon with other people's selfishness. If they gave
good advice or corrected her, it was not so much out
of consideration for her as for their own ends. Should
she meet the bigger girls on the road, and happen to
have an apple in her hand, they would say to her:
"Fling that horrible apple away, or you'll get worms!"
But Ditte no longer threw the apple away; she had
found out that they only picked it up as soon as she had
gone, to eat it themselves. Things were not what they
appeared to be, more often than not there was something
behind what one saw and heard.</p>

<p>Some people declared, that things really meant for
one were put behind a back&mdash;a stick, for instance; it
was always wise to be on the watch.</p>

<p>With Granny naturally it was not like this. She was
simply Granny through all their ups and downs, and
one need never beware of her. She was only more
whining than she used to be, and could no longer earn
their living. Ditte had to bear the greatest share of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the burden, and was already capable of getting necessities
for the house; she knew when the farmers were
killing or churning, and would stand barefooted begging
for a little for Granny. "Why don't you get poor
relief?" said some, but gave all the same; the needy
must not be turned away from one's door, if one's
food were to be blessed. But under these new conditions
it was impossible to have any respect for Granny,
who was treated more as a spoiled child, and often corrected
and then comforted.</p>

<p>"Ay, 'tis all very well for you," said the old woman&mdash;"you've
got sight and good legs, the whole world's
afore you. But I've only the grave to look forward
to."</p>

<p>"Do you want to die?" asked Ditte, "and go to
old Grandfather Sören?"</p>

<p>Indeed, no, Granny did not wish to die. But she
could not help thinking of the grave; it drew her and
yet frightened her. Her tired limbs were never really
rested, and a long, long sleep under the green by Sören's
side was a tempting thought, if only one could be sure
of not feeling the cold. Yes, and that the child was
looked after, of course.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go over to my new father," declared
Ditte whenever it was spoken of. Granny need have
no fear for her. "But do you think Grandfather
Sören's still there?"</p>

<p>Yes, that was what old Maren was not quite sure
of herself. She could so well imagine the grave as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the end of everything, and rest peacefully with that
thought; oh! the blissfulness of laying one's tired
head where no carts could be heard, and to be free for
all eternity from aches and pains and troubles, and
only rest. Perhaps this would not be allowed&mdash;there
was so much talking: the parson said one thing and
the lay preacher another. Sören might not be there any
longer, and she would have to search for him till she
found him, which would be difficult enough if after
death he had been transformed to youth again. Sören
had been wild and dissipated. Where he was, Maren
must also be, there was no doubt about that. But she
preferred to have it arranged so that she could have
a long rest by Sören's side, as a reward for all those
weary years.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go to my new father!" repeated Ditte.
This had become her refrain.</p>

<p>"Ay, just as ye like!" answered Maren harshly.
She did not like the child taking the subject so calmly.</p>

<p>But Ditte needed some one who could secure her
future. Granny was no good, she was too old and
helpless, and she was a woman. There ought to be a
man! And now she had found him. She lay down to
sleep behind Granny with a new feeling now; she had
a real father, just like other children, one who was
married to her mother, and in addition possessed a
horse and cart. The bald young owner of the Sand
farm, who was so thin and mean that he froze everybody
near him, she never took to, he was too cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
for that. But the rag and bone man had taken her
on his knee and shouted in her ear with his big blustering
voice. They might shout "brat" after her as
much as they liked, for all she cared. She had a father
taller than any of theirs, he had to bend his head when
he stood under the beams in Granny's sitting room.</p>

<p>The outlook was so much better now, one fell asleep
feeling richer and woke again&mdash;not disappointed as
when one had dreamt&mdash;but with a feeling of security.
Such a father was much better to depend upon, than an
old blind Granny, who was nothing but a bundle of
rags. Every night when Granny undressed, Ditte was
equally astonished at seeing her take off skirt after
skirt, getting thinner and thinner until, as if by witchcraft,
nothing was left of the fat grandmother but a
skeleton, a withered little crone, who wheezed like the
leaky bellows by the fireplace.</p>

<p>They looked forward to the day when the new father
would come and fetch them to the wedding. Then of
course it would be in a grand carriage&mdash;the other one
was only a cart. It would happen when they were most
wearied with life, not knowing where to turn for food
or coffee. Suddenly they would hear the cheerful crack
of a whip outside, and there he would stand, saluting
with his whip, the rascal; and as they got into the carriage,
he would sit at attention with his whip&mdash;like the
coachman on the estate.</p>

<p>Maren, poor soul, had never seen a carriage at her
door; she was almost more excited than the child, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
described it all to her. "And little I thought any
carriage would ever come for me, but the one that took
me to the churchyard," she would say each time. "But
your mother, she always had a weakness for what is
grand."</p>

<p>There had come excitement into their poor lives.
Ditte was no longer bored, and did not have to invent
mischief to keep her little mind occupied. She had also
developed a certain feeling of responsibility towards
her grandmother, now that she was dependent on her&mdash;they
got on much better together. "You're very
good to your old Granny, child," Maren would often
say, and then they would cry over each other without
knowing why.</p>

<p>The little wide-awake girl now had to be eyes for
Granny as well, and old Maren had to learn to see
things through Ditte. And as soon as she got used to
it and put implicit faith in the child, all went well.
Whenever Ditte was tempted to make fun, Maren had
only to say: "You're not playing tricks, are you,
child?" and she would immediately stop. She was intelligent
and quick, and Maren could wish for no better
eyes than hers, failing the use of her own. There she
would sit fumbling and turning her sightless eyes
towards every sound without discovering what it could
be. But thanks to Ditte she was able by degrees to take
up part of her old life again.</p>

<p>Perhaps after all she missed the skies more than
anything else. The weather had always played a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
part in Maren's life; not so much the weather that was,
as that to come. This was the fishergirl in her; she
took after her mother&mdash;and her mother again&mdash;from
the time she began to take notice she would peer at the
skies early and late. Everything was governed by
them, even their food from day to day, and when they
were dark&mdash;it cleared the table once and for all by
taking the bread-winner. The sky was the first thing
her eyes sought for in the morning, and the last to
dwell upon at night. "There'll be a storm in the
night," she would say, as she came in, or: "It'll be a
good day for fishing tomorrow!" Ditte never understood
how she knew this.</p>

<p>Maren seldom went out now, so it did not matter to
her what the weather was, but she was still as much
interested in it. "What's the sky like?" she would
often ask. Ditte would run out and peer anxiously
at the skies, very much taken up with her commission.</p>

<p>"'Tis red," she announced on her return, "and
there's a man riding over it on a wet, wet horse. Is it
going to rain then?"</p>

<p>"Is the sun going down into a sack?" asked Granny.
Ditte ran out again to see.</p>

<p>"There's no sun at all," she came in and announced
with excitement.</p>

<p>But Granny shook her head, there was nothing to
be made of the child's explanation; she was too imaginative.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you seen the cat eat grass today?" asked
Maren after a short silence.</p>

<p>No, Ditte had not seen it do that. But it had jumped
after flies.</p>

<p>Maren considered for a while. Well, well, it probably
meant nothing good. "Go and see if there are
stars under the coffee kettle," said she.</p>

<p>Ditte lifted the heavy copper kettle from the fire&mdash;yes,
there were stars of fire in the soot, they swarmed
over the bottom of the kettle in a glittering mass.</p>

<p>"Then it'll be stormy," said Granny relieved. "I've
felt it for days in my bones." Should there be a storm,
Maren always remembered to say: "Now, you see, I
was right." And Ditte wondered over her Granny's
wisdom.</p>

<p>"Is that why folks call you 'wise Maren'?" asked
she.</p>

<p>"Ay, that's it. But it doesn't need much to be wiser
than the others&mdash;if only one has sight. For folks are
stupid&mdash;most of them."</p>

<p>Lars Peter Hansen they neither saw nor heard of
for nearly a year. When people drove past, who
they thought might come from his locality, they would
make inquiries; but were never much wiser for all they
heard. At last they began to wonder whether he really
did exist; it was surely not a dream like the fairy-house
in the wood?</p>

<p>And then one day he actually stood at the door.
He did not exactly crack his whip&mdash;a long hazel-stick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
with a piece of string at the end&mdash;but he tried to do it,
and the old nag answered by throwing back its head
and whinnying. It was the same cart as before, but a
seat with a green upholstered back, from which the
stuffing protruded, had been put on. His big battered
hat was the same too, it was shiny from age and full of
dust, and with bits of straw and spiders' webs in the
dents. From underneath it his tousled hair showed, so
covered with dust and burrs and other things that the
birds of the air might be tempted to build their nests
in it.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you say to a little drive today?" he
shouted gaily, as he tramped in. "I've brought fine
weather with me, what?"</p>

<p>He might easily do that, for even yesterday Granny
had seen to it that the weather should be fine, although
she knew nothing of this. Last evening she touched the
dew on the window-pane with her hand and had said:
"There's dew for the morning sun to sparkle on."</p>

<p>Lars Peter Hansen had to wait, while Ditte lit the
fire and made coffee for him. "What a clever girl you
are," he burst out, as she put it in front of him, "you
must have a kiss." He took her in his arms and kissed
her; Ditte put her face against his rough cheek and
did not speak a word. Suddenly he realized his cheek
was wet, and turned her face toward his. "Have I
hurt you?" he asked alarmed, and put her down.</p>

<p>"Nay, never a bit," said the old woman. "The
child has been looking forward to a kiss from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
father, and now it has come to pass&mdash;little as it is.
You let her have her cry out; childish tears only wet
the cheeks."</p>

<p>But Lars Peter Hansen went into the peat shed,
where he found Ditte sobbing. Gently raising her, he
dried her cheeks with his checked handkerchief, which
looked as if it had been out many times before
today.</p>

<p>"We'll be friends sure enough, we two&mdash;we'll be
friends sure enough," he repeated soothingly. His
deep voice comforted the child, she took his hand and
followed him back again.</p>

<p>Granny, who was very fond of coffee, though she
would never say so, had seized the opportunity to take
an extra cup while they were out. In her haste to pour
it out, some had been spilt on the table, and now she
was trying to wipe it up in the hope it might not be
seen. Ditte helped her to take off her apron, and
washed her skirt with a wet cloth, so that it should not
leave a mark; she looked quite motherly. She herself
would have no coffee, she was so overwhelmed with
happiness, that she could not eat.</p>

<p>Then the old woman was well wrapped up, and
Lars Peter lifted them into the cart. Granny was put
on the seat by his side, while Ditte, who was to have sat
on the fodder-bag at the back, placed herself at their
feet, for company. Lars took up the reins, pulled
them tightly, and loosened them again; having done this
several times, the old nag started with a jerk, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
almost upset their balance, and off they went into the
country.</p>

<p>It was glorious sunshine. Straight ahead the rolling
downs lay bathed in it&mdash;and beyond, the country with
forest and hill. It all looked so different from the cart,
than when walking with bare feet along the road;
all seemed to curtsey to Ditte, hills and forests and
everything. She was not used to driving, and this was
the first time she had driven in state and looked down
on things. All those dreary hills that on other days
stretched so heavily and monotonously in front of her,
and had often been too much for her small feet, today
lay down and said: "Yes, Ditte, you may drive over us
with pleasure!" Granny did not share in all this, but
she could feel the sun on her old back and was quite in
holiday mood.</p>

<p>The old nag took its own time, and Lars Peter
Hansen had no objection. He sat the whole time
lightly touching it with his whip, a habit of his, and one
without which the horse could not proceed. Should he
stop for one moment, while pointing with his whip at
the landscape, it would toss its head with impatience
and look back&mdash;greatly to Ditte's enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Can't it gallop at all?" asked she, propping herself
up between his knees.</p>

<p>"Rather, just you wait and see!" answered Lars
Peter Hansen proudly. He pulled in the reins, but the
nag only stopped, turned round, and looked at him with
astonishment. For each lash of the whip, it threw up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
its tail and sawed the air with its head. Ditte's little
body tingled with enjoyment.</p>

<p>"'Tisn't in the mood today," said Lars Peter Hansen,
when he had at last got it into its old trot again. "It
thinks it's a fraud to expect it to gallop, when it's been
taking such long paces all the time."</p>

<p>"Did it say that?" asked Ditte, her eyes traveling
from the one to the other.</p>

<p>"That's what it's supposed to mean. It's not far
wrong."</p>

<p>Long paces it certainly did take&mdash;about that there
was no mistake&mdash;but never two of equal length, and
the cart was rolling in a zigzag all the time. What a
funny horse it was. It looked as if it was made of odd
parts, so bony and misshapen was it. No two parts
matched, and its limbs groaned and creaked with every
movement.</p>

<p>They drove past the big estate, where the squire
lived, over the common, and still further out into the
country which Granny had never seen before.</p>

<p>"But you can't see it now either," corrected Ditte
pedantically.</p>

<p>"Oh, you always want to split hairs, 'course I can
see it! When I hear you two speak, I see everything
quite plainly. 'Tis a gift of God, to live through all this
in my old days. But I smell something sweet, what is
it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe 'tis the fresh water, Granny," said Lars
Peter. "Two or three miles down to the left is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
big lake. Granny has a sharp nose for anything that's
wet." He chuckled over his little joke.</p>

<p>"'Tis water folks can drink without harm," said
Maren thoughtfully; "Sören's told me about it. We
were going to take a trip down there fishing for eels, but
we never did. Ay, they say 'tis a pretty sight over the
water to see the glare of the fires on the summer
nights."</p>

<p>In between Lars Peter told them about conditions
in his home. It was not exactly the wedding they were
going to, for they had married about nine months ago&mdash;secretly.
"'Twas done in a hurry," he apologetically
explained, "or you two would have been there."</p>

<p>Maren became silent; she had looked forward to
being present at the wedding of one of her girls at
least, and nothing had come of it. Otherwise, it was
a lovely trip.</p>

<p>"Have you any little ones then?" she asked shortly
after.</p>

<p>"A boy," answered Lars Peter, "a proper little
monkey&mdash;the image of his mother!" He was quite
enthusiastic at the thought of the child. "Sörine's
expecting another one soon," he added quietly.</p>

<p>"You're getting on," said Maren. "How is she?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so well this time. 'Tis the heartburn,
she says."</p>

<p>"Then 'twill be a long-haired girl," Maren declared
definitely. "And well on the way she must be, for the
hair to stick in the mother's throat."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a beautiful September day. Everything smelt
of mold, and the air was full of moisture, which could
be seen as crystal drops over the sunlit land; a blue
haze hung between the trees sinking to rest in the undergrowth,
so that meadow and moor looked like a glimmering
white sea.</p>

<p>Ditte marveled at the endlessness of the world.
Constantly something new could be seen: forests, villages,
churches; only the end of the world, which she
expected every moment to see and put an end to everything,
failed to appear. To the south some towers
shone in the sun; it was a king's palace, said her father&mdash;her
little heart mounted to her throat when he said
that. And still further ahead&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's that I smell now?" Granny suddenly said,
sniffing the air. "'Tis salt! We must be near the
sea."</p>

<p>"Not just what one would call near, 'tis over seven
miles away. Can you really smell the sea?"</p>

<p>Ay, ay, no-one need tell Maren that they neared the
sea; she had spent all her life near it and ought to
know. "And what sea is that?" asked she.</p>

<p>"The same as yours," answered Lars Peter.</p>

<p>"That's little enough to drive through the country
for," said Maren laughingly.</p>

<p>And then they were at the end of their journey. It
was quite a shock to them, when the nag suddenly
stopped and Lars Peter sprang down from the cart.
"Now, then," said he, lifting them down. Sörine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
came out with the boy in her arms; she was big and
strong and had rough manners.</p>

<p>Ditte was afraid of this big red woman, and took
refuge behind Granny. "She doesn't know you, that's
why," said Maren, "she'll soon be all right."</p>

<p>But Sörine was angry. "Now, no more nonsense,
child," said she, dragging her forward. "Kiss your
mother at once."</p>

<p>Ditte began to howl, and tore herself away from her.
Sörine looked as if she would have liked to use a
parent's privilege and punish the child then and there.
Her husband came between by snatching the child from
her and placing her on the back of the horse. "Pat
the kind horse and say thank you for the nice drive,"
said he. Thus he quieted Ditte, and carried her to
Sörine. "Kiss mother," he said, and Ditte put forth
her little mouth invitingly. But now Sörine refused.
She looked at the child angrily, and went to get water
for the horse.</p>

<p>Sörine had killed a couple of chickens in their honor,
and on the whole made them comfortable, as far as
their food and drink went; but there was a lack of
friendliness which made itself felt. She had always
been cold and selfish, and had not improved with years.
By the next morning old Maren saw it was quite time
for them to return home, and against this Sörine did
not demur. After dinner Lars Peter harnessed the
old nag, lifted them into the cart, and off they set homewards,
relieved that it was over. Even Lars Peter was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
different out in the open to what he was at home. He
sang and cracked jokes, while home he was quiet and
said little.</p>

<p>They were thankful to be home again in the hut on
the Naze. "Thank the Lord, 'tis not your mother
we've to look to for our daily bread," said Granny,
when Lars Peter Hansen had taken leave; and Ditte
threw her arms round the old woman's neck and kissed
her. Today she realized fully Granny's true worth.</p>

<p>It had been somewhat of a disappointment. Sörine
was not what they had expected her to be, and her
home was not up to much. As far as Granny found
out from Ditte's description, it was more like a mud-hut,
which had been given the name of dwelling-house,
barn, etc. In no way could it be compared with the hut
on the Naze.</p>

<p>But the drive had been beautiful.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_XII" id="I_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
The Rag And Bone Man</span></h2>


<p>All who knew Lars Peter Hansen agreed that he
was a comical fellow. He was always in a good
temper, and really there was no reason why he
should be&mdash;especially where he was concerned. He
belonged to a race of rag and bone men, who as far
back as any one could remember, had traded in what
others would not touch, and had therefore been given
the name of rag and bone folk. His father drove
with dogs and bought up rags and bones and other
unclean refuse; when a sick or tainted animal had to be
done away with he was always sent for. He was a
fellow who never minded what he did, and would bury
his arms up to the elbows in the worst kind of carrion,
and then go straight to his dinner without even rinsing
his fingers in water; people declared that in the
middle of the night he would go and dig up the dead
animals and strip them of their skin. His father, it was
said, had gone as a boy to give his uncle a helping
hand. As an example of the boy's depravity, it was
said that when the rope would not tighten round the
neck of a man who was being hung, he would climb up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the gallows, drop down on to the unfortunate man's
shoulder, and sit there.</p>

<p>There was not much to inherit, and there was absolutely
nothing to be proud of. Lars Peter had probably
felt this, for when quite young he had turned his back
on the home of his childhood. He crossed the water
and tried for work in North Sea land&mdash;his ambition was
to be a farmer. He was a steady and respectable
fellow, and as strong as a horse, any farmer would
willingly employ him.</p>

<p>But if he thought he could run away from things,
he was mistaken. Rumors of his origin followed faithfully
at his heels, and harmed him at every turn. He
might just as well have tried to fly from his own
shadow.</p>

<p>Fortunately it did not affect him much. He was
good-natured&mdash;wherever he had got it from&mdash;there
was not a bad thought in his mind. His strength and
trustworthiness made up for his low origin, so that he
was able to hold his own with other young men; it even
happened, that a well-to-do girl fell in love with his
strength and black hair, and wanted him for a husband.
In spite of her family's opposition they became engaged;
but very soon she died, so he did not get hold of her
money.</p>

<p>So unlucky was he in everything, that it seemed as if
the sins of his fathers were visited upon him. But Lars
Peter took it as the way of the world. He toiled and
saved, till he had scraped together sufficient money to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
clear a small piece of land on the Sand&mdash;and once
again looked for a wife. He met a girl from one of
the fishing-hamlets; they took to each other, and he
married her.</p>

<p>There are people, upon whose roof the bird of misfortune
always sits flapping its black wings. It is generally
invisible to all but the inmates of the house; but
it may happen, that all others see it, except those whom
it visits.</p>

<p>Lars Peter was one of those whom people always
watched for something to happen. To his race stuck
the two biggest mysteries of all&mdash;the blood and the
curse; that he himself was good and happy made it no
less exciting. Something surely was in store for him;
every one could see the bird of misfortune on his
roof.</p>

<p>He himself saw nothing, and with confidence took his
bride home. No one told him that she had been engaged
to a sailor, who was drowned; and anyway, what
good would it have done? Lars Peter was not the
man to be frightened away by the dead, he was at
odds with no man. And no one can escape his
fate.</p>

<p>They were as happy together as any two human
beings can be; Lars Peter was good to her, and when
he had finished his own work, would help her with
the milking, and carry water in for her. Hansine was
happy and satisfied; every one could see she had got a
good husband. The bird that lived on their roof could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
be none other than the stork, for before long Hansine
confided in Lars Peter that she was with child.</p>

<p>It was the most glorious news he had ever had in his
life, and if he had worked hard before he did even
more so now. His evenings were spent in the woodshed;
there was a cradle to be made, and a rocking-chair,
and small wooden shoes to be carved. As he
worked he would hum, something slightly resembling
a melody, but always the same tune; then suddenly
Hansine would come running out throwing herself into
his arms. She had become so strange under her pregnancy,
she could find no rest, and would sit for hours
with her thoughts far away&mdash;as if listening to distant
voices&mdash;and could not be roused up again. Lars
Peter put it down to her condition, and took it all good-humoredly.
His even temperament had a soothing
effect upon her, and she was soon happy again. But
at times she was full of anxiety, and would run out to
him in the fields, almost beside herself. It was almost
impossible to persuade her to return to the house, he
only succeeded after promising to keep within sight.
She was afraid of one thing or another at home, but
when he urged her to tell him the reason, she would
look dumbly at him.</p>

<p>After the child's birth, she was her old self again.
Their delight was great in the little one, and they were
happier even than before.</p>

<p>But this strange phase returned when she again
became pregnant, only in a stronger degree. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
were times, when her fear forced her out of the house,
and she would run into the fields, wring her hands in
anguish. The distracted husband would fetch the
screaming child to her, thus tempting her home again.
This time she gave in and confided in him, that she had
been engaged to a sailor, who had made her promise
that she would remain faithful, if anything happened to
him at sea.</p>

<p>"Did he never come back then?" asked Lars Peter
slowly.</p>

<p>Hansine shook her head. And he had threatened to
return and claim her, if she broke her word. He had
said, he would tap on the trap-door in the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Did you promise of your own free will?" Lars
Peter said ponderously.</p>

<p>No, Hansine thought he had pressed her.</p>

<p>"Then you're not bound by it," said he. "My
family, maybe, are not much to go by, scum of the
earth as we are. But my father and my grandfather
always used to say, there's no need to fear the dead;
they were easier to get away from than the living."
She sat bending over the babe, which had cried itself to
sleep on her knees, and Lars Peter stood with his arms
round her shoulder, softly rocking her backwards and
forwards, as he tried to talk her to reason. "You
must think of the little one here&mdash;and the other little
one to come! The only thing which can't be forgiven,
is unkindness to those given to us."</p>

<p>Hansine took his hand and pressed it against her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
tearful eyes. Then rising herself she put the child to
bed; she was calm now.</p>

<p>The rag and bone man had no superstition of any
kind, or fear either, it was the only bright touch in the
darkness of his race that they possessed; this property
caused them to be outcasts&mdash;and decided their trade.
Those who are not haunted, haunt others.</p>

<p>The only curse he knew, was the curse of being an
outcast and feared; and this, thank the Lord, had been
removed where he was concerned. He did not believe
in persecution from a dead man. But he understood the
serious effect it had upon Hansine, and was much
troubled on her account. Before going to bed, he took
down the trap-door and hid it under the roof.</p>

<p>Thus they had children one after the other, and with
it trouble and depression. Instead of becoming better
it grew worse with each one; and as much as Lars
Peter loved his children, he hoped each one would be
the last. The children themselves bore no mark of having
been carried under a heart full of fear. They
were like small shining suns, who encircled him all day
long from the moment they could move. They added
enjoyment to his work, and as each new one made its
appearance, he received it as a gift of God. His huge
fists entirely covered the newly born babe, when handed
to him by the midwife&mdash;looking in its swaddling clothes
like the leg of a boot&mdash;as he lifted it to the ceiling. His
voice in its joy was like the deep chime of a bell, and
the babe's head rolled from side to side, while blinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
its eyes at the light. Never had any one been so grateful
for children, wife and everything else as Lars Peter.
He was filled with admiration for them all, it was a
glorious world.</p>

<p>He did not exactly make headway on his little farm.
It was poor land, and Lars Peter was said to be unlucky.
Either he lost an animal or the crop was spoiled
by hail. Other people kept an account of these accidents,
Lars Peter himself had no feeling of being
treated badly. On the contrary he was thankful for his
farm, and toiled patiently on it. Nothing affected
him.</p>

<p>When Hansine was to have her fifth child, she was
worse than ever. She had made him put up the trap-door
again, on the pretense that she could not stay in
the kitchen for the draught, and she would be nowhere
else but there&mdash;she was waiting for the tap. She complained
no longer nor on the whole was she anxious
either. It was as if she had learned to endure what
could not be evaded; she was absent-minded, and Lars
Peter had the sad feeling that she no longer belonged
to him. In the night he would suddenly realize that she
was missing from his side&mdash;and would find her in the
kitchen stiff with cold. He carried her back to bed,
soothing her like a little child, and she would fall asleep
on his breast.</p>

<p>Her condition was such, that he never dared go from
home, and leave her alone with the children; he had to
engage a woman to keep an eye on her, and look after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the house. She now neglected everything and looked
at the children as if they were the cause of her
trouble.</p>

<p>One day when he was taking a load of peat to town,
an awful thing happened. What Hansine had been
waiting for so long, now actually took place. She sent
the woman, who was supposed to be with her, away
on some excuse or other; and when Lars Peter returned,
the animals were bellowing and every door
open. There was no sign of wife or children. The
poultry slipped past him, as he went round calling.
He found them all in the well. It was a fearful sight to
see the mother and four children lying in a row, first
on the cobble-stoned yard, wet and pitiful, and afterwards
on the sitting-room table dressed for burial.
Without a doubt the sailor had claimed his right! The
mother had jumped down last, with the youngest in
her arms; they found her like this, tightly clasping the
child, though she had not deserved it.</p>

<p>Every one was deeply shocked by this dreadful occurrence.
They would willingly have given him a comforting
and helping hand now; but it seemed that nothing
could be done to help him in his trouble. He did
not easily accept favors.</p>

<p>He busied himself round and about the dead, until
the day of the funeral. No one saw him shed a single
tear, not even when the earth was thrown on to the
coffins, and people wondered at his composure; he had
clung so closely to them. He was probably one of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
who were cursed with inability to cry, thought the
women.</p>

<p>After the funeral, he asked a neighbor to look after
his animals; he had to go to town, said he. With that
he disappeared, and for two years he was not seen;
it was understood that he had gone to sea. The farm
was taken over by the creditors; there was no more
than would pay what he owed, so that at all events,
he did not lose anything by it.</p>

<p>One day he suddenly cropped up again, the same old
Lars Peter, prepared, like Job, to start again from the
beginning. He had saved a little money in the last two
years, and bought a partly ruined hut, a short distance
north of his former farm. With the hut went a bit of
marsh, and a few acres of poor land, which had never
been under the plow. He bought a few sheep and
poultry, put up an outhouse of peat and reeds taken
from the marsh&mdash;and settled himself in. He dug peat
and sold it, and when there was a good catch of herrings,
would go down to the nearest fishing hamlet with
his wheelbarrow and buy a load, taking them from
hut to hut. He preferred to barter them, taking in
exchange old metal, rags and bones, etc. It was the
trade of his race he took up again, and although he
had never practised it before, he fell into it quite easily.
One day he took home a big bony horse, which he had
got cheap, because no-one else had any use for it;
another day he brought Sörine home. Everything
went well for him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>He had met Sörine at some gathering down in one
of the fishing huts, and they quickly made a match of it.
She was tired of her place and he of being alone; so
they threw in their lot together.</p>

<p>He was out the whole day long, and often at night
too. When the fishing season was in full swing, he
would leave home at one or two o'clock in the night,
to be at the hamlet when the first boats came in. On
these occasions Sörine stayed up to see that he did not
oversleep himself. This irregular life came as naturally
to her as to him, and she was a great help to
him. So now once more he had a wife, and one who
could work too. He possessed a horse, which had no
equal in all the land&mdash;and a farm! It was not what
could be called an estate, the house was built of hay,
mud and sticks; people would point laughingly at it as
they passed. Lars Peter alone was thankful for it.</p>

<p>He was a satisfied being&mdash;rather too much so,
thought Sörine. She was of a different nature, always
straining forward, and pushing him along so that her
position might be bettered. She was an ambitious
woman. When he was away, she managed everything;
and the first summer helped him to build a proper outhouse,
of old beams and bricks, which she made herself
by drying clay in the sun. "Now we've a place for
the animals just like other people," said she, when it
was finished. But her voice showed that she was not
satisfied.</p>

<p>At times Lars Peter Hansen would suggest that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
ought to take Granny and Ditte to live with them.
"They're so lonely and dull," said he, "and the Lord
only knows where they get food from."</p>

<p>But this Sörine would not hear of. "We've enough
to do without them," answered she sharply, "and
Mother's not in want, I'm sure. She was always clever
at helping herself. If they come here, I'll have the
money paid for Ditte. 'Tis mine by right."</p>

<p>"They'll have eaten that up long ago," said Lars
Peter.</p>

<p>But Sörine did not think so; it would not be like her
father or her mother. She was convinced that her
mother had hidden it somewhere or other. "If she
would only sell the hut, and give the money to us," said
she. "Then we could build a new house."</p>

<p>"Much wants more!" answered Lars Peter smilingly.
In his opinion the house they lived in was quite
good enough. But he was a man who thought anything
good enough for him, and nothing too good for
others. If he were allowed to rule they would soon
end in the workhouse!</p>

<p>So Lars Peter avoided the question, and after
Granny's visit, and having seen her and Sörine together,
he understood they would be best apart. They
did not come to his home again, but when he was buying
up in their part of the country, he would call in at
the hut on the Naze and take a cup of coffee with them.
He would then bring a paper of coffee and some cakes
with him, so as not to take them unawares, and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
other small gifts too. These were days of rejoicing
in the little hut. They longed for him, from one
visit to another, and could talk of very little else.
Whenever there were sounds of wheels, Ditte would
fly to the window, and Granny would open wide her
sightless eyes. Ditte gathered old iron from the shore
as a surprise for her father; and when he drove home,
she would go with him as far as the big hill, behind
which the sun went down.</p>

<p>Lars Peter said nothing of these visits when he got
home.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_XIII" id="I_CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
Ditte Has A Vision</span></h2>


<p>Before losing her sight Maren had taught Ditte
to read, which came in very useful now. They
never went to church; their clothes were too shabby,
and the way too long. Maren was not particularly
zealous in her attendance, a life-long experience
had taught her to take what the parson said with a
grain of salt. But on Sundays, when people streamed
past on their way to church, they were both neatly
dressed, Ditte with a clean pinafore and polished
wooden shoes, and Granny with a stringed cap. Then
Granny would be sitting in the armchair at the table,
spectacles on her nose and the Bible in front of her,
and Ditte standing beside her reading the scriptures
for the day. In spite of her blindness, Maren insisted
upon wearing her spectacles and having the holy book
in front of her, according to custom, otherwise it was
not right.</p>

<p>Ditte was nearly of school age, but Maren took no
notice of it, and kept her home. She was afraid of the
child not getting on with the other children&mdash;and could
not imagine how she herself could spare her the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
day long. But at the end of six months they were found
out, and Maren was threatened, that unless the child
was sent to school, she would be taken from her altogether.</p>

<p>Having fitted out Ditte as well as she could, she sent
her off with a heavy heart. The birth certificate she
purposely omitted giving her; as it bore in the corner
the fateful: born out of wedlock. Maren could not
understand why an innocent child should be stamped as
unclean; the child had enough to fight against without
that. But Ditte returned with strict injunctions to bring
the certificate the next day, and Maren was obliged to
give it to her. It was hopeless to fight against injustice.</p>

<p>Maren knew well that magistrates were no institution
of God's making&mdash;she had been born with this
knowledge! They only oppressed her and her kind;
and with this end in view used their own hard method,
which was none of God's doing at all. He, on the contrary,
was a friend of the poor; at least His only son,
who was sitting on His right hand, whispered good
things of the poor, and it was reasonable to expect that
He would willingly help. But what did it help when
the mighty ones would have it otherwise? It was the
squire and his like, who had the power! It was towards
them the parson turned when preaching, letting the
poor folks look after themselves, and towards them the
deacon glanced when singing. It was all very fine for
them, with the magistrate carrying their trains, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
opening their carriage door, with a peasant woman always
ready to lay herself on all fours to prevent them
wetting their feet as they stepped in. No "born out of
wedlock" on <i>their</i> birth certificate; although one often
might question their genuineness!</p>

<p>"But why does the Lord let it be like that?" asked
Ditte wonderingly.</p>

<p>"He has to, or there'd be no churches built nor no
fuss made of Him," answered Maren. "Grandfather
Sören always said, that the Lord lived in the pockets of
the mighty, and it seems as if he's right."</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>Ditte now went three times a week to school, which
lay an hour's journey away, over the common. She
went together with the other children from the hamlet,
and got on well with them.</p>

<p>Children are thoughtless, but not wicked; this they
learn from their elders. They had only called after her
what they had heard at home; it was their parents'
gossip and judgment they had repeated. They meant
nothing by it; Ditte, who was observant in this respect,
soon found out that they treated each other just in the
same way. They would shout witch's brat, at her one
minute and the next be quite friendly; they did not
mean to look down upon her. This discovery took the
sting from the abusive word&mdash;fortunately she was not
sensitive. And the parents no longer, in superstition,
warned their children against her; the time when Maren
rode about as a witch was entirely forgotten. Now she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
was only a poor old woman left alone with an illegitimate
child.</p>

<p>To the school came children just as far in the opposite
direction, from the neighborhood of Sand. And
it happened, that from them Maren and Ditte could
make inquiries about Sörine and Lars Peter. They
had not seen Ditte's father for some time, and he might
easily have met with an accident, being on the roads
night and day in all sorts of weather. It was fortunate
that Ditte met children from those parts, who could
assure her that all was well. Sörine had never been any
good to her mother, although she was her own flesh and
blood.</p>

<p>One day Ditte came home with the news that she was
to go to her parents; one of the children had brought
the message.</p>

<p>Old Maren began to shake, so that her knitting
needles clinked.</p>

<p>"But they said they didn't want you!" she broke
out, her face quivering.</p>

<p>"Yes, but now they want me&mdash;you see, I've to help
with the little ones," answered Ditte proudly, gathering
her possessions together and putting them on the table.
Each time she put a thing down was like a stab to the
old woman; then she would comfort and stroke
Granny's shaking hand, which was nothing but blue
veins. Maren sat dumbly knitting; her face was
strangely set and dead-looking.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll come home and see you; but then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
you must take it sensibly. Can't you understand that
I couldn't stay with you always? I'll bring some coffee
when I come, and we'll have a lovely time. But
you must promise not to cry, 'cause your eyes can't
stand it."</p>

<p>Ditte stood talking in a would-be wise voice, as she
tied up her things.</p>

<p>"And now I must go, or I shan't get there till night,
and then mother will be angry." She said the word
"mother" with a certain reverence as if it swept away
all objections. "Good-by, dear, <i>dear</i> Granny!" She
kissed the old woman's cheek and hurried off with her
bundle.</p>

<p>As soon as the door had closed on her Maren began
crying, and calling for her; in a monotonous undertone
she poured out all her troubles, sorrow and want and
longing for death. She had had so many heavy burdens
and had barely finished with one when another appeared.
Her hardships had cut deeply&mdash;most of them;
and it did her good to live through them again and
again. She went on for some time, and would have
gone on still longer had she not suddenly felt two
arms round her neck and a wet cheek against her own.
It was the mischievous child, who had returned, saying
that after all she was not leaving her.</p>

<p>Ditte had gone some distance, as far as the baker's,
who wondered where she was going with the big parcel
and stopped her. Her explanation, that she was going
home to her parents, they refused to believe; her father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
had said nothing about it when the baker had met him
at the market the day before, indeed he had sent his
love to them. Ditte stood perplexed on hearing all
this. A sudden doubt flashed through her mind; she
turned round with a jerk&mdash;quick as she was in all her
movements&mdash;and set off home for the hut on the Naze.
How it had all happened she did not bother to think,
such was her relief at being allowed to return to
Granny.</p>

<p>Granny laughed and cried at the same time, asked
questions and could make no sense of it.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going at all, then?" she broke out,
thanking God, and hardly able to believe it.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm not going. Haven't I just told you,
the baker said I wasn't to."</p>

<p>"Ay, the baker, the baker&mdash;what's he got to do
with it? You'd got the message to go."</p>

<p>Ditte was busily poking her nose into Granny's cheek.</p>

<p>Maren lifted her head: "Hadn't you, child?
Answer me!"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Granny," said Ditte, hiding her face
against her.</p>

<p>Granny held her at an arm's length: "Then you've
been playing tricks, you bad girl! Shame on you, to
treat my poor old heart like this." Maren began sobbing
again and could not stop; it had all come so unexpectedly.
If only one could get to the bottom of it;
but the child had declared that she had not told a lie.
She was quite certain of having had the message, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
was grieved at Granny not believing her. She never
told an untruth when it came to the point, so after all
must have had the message. On the other side the
child herself said that she was not going&mdash;although
the baker's counter orders carried no authority. They
had simply stopped her, because her expedition seemed
so extraordinary. It was beyond Maren&mdash;unless the
child had imagined it all.</p>

<p>Ditte kept close to the old woman, constantly taking
hold of her chin. "Now I know how sorry you'll be to
lose me altogether," she said quietly.</p>

<p>Maren raised her face: "Do you think you'll soon
be called away?"</p>

<p>Ditte shook her head so vehemently that Granny
felt it.</p>

<p>Old Maren was deep in thought; she had known before
that the child understood, that it was bound to
come.</p>

<p>"Whatever it may be," said she after a few moments,
"you've behaved like the great man I once read
about, who rehearsed his own funeral&mdash;with four black
horses, hearse and everything. All his servants had to
pretend they were the procession, dressed in black, they
had even to cry. He himself was watching from an
attic window, and when he saw the servants laughing
behind their handkerchiefs instead of crying, he took it
so to heart that he died. 'Tis dangerous for folks to
make fun of their own passing away&mdash;wherever they
may be going!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wasn't making fun, Granny," Ditte assured her
again.</p>

<p>From that day Maren went in daily dread of the
child being claimed by her parents. "My ears are burning,"
she often said, "maybe 'tis your mother talking
of us."</p>

<p>Sörine certainly did talk of them in those days. Ditte
was now old enough to make herself useful; her mother
would not mind having her home to look after the little
ones. "She's nearly nine years old now and we'll
have to take her sooner or later," she explained.</p>

<p>Lars Peter demurred; he thought it was a shame
to take her from Granny. "Let's take them both
then," said he.</p>

<p>Sörine refused to listen, and nagged for so long that
she overcame his opposition.</p>

<p>"We've been expecting you," said Maren when at
last he came to fetch the child. "We've known for
long that you'd come on this errand."</p>

<p>"'Tisn't exactly with my good will. But in a way
a mother has a right to her own child, and Sörine thinks
she'd like to have her," answered Lars Peter. He
wanted to smooth it down for both sides.</p>

<p>"I know you've done your best. Well, it can't be
helped. And how's every one at home? There's another
mouth to feed, I've heard."</p>

<p>"Ay, he's nearly six months old now." Lars Peter
brightened up, as he always did when speaking of his
children.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>They got into the cart. "We shan't forget you,
either of us," said Lars Peter huskily, while trying to
get the old nag off.</p>

<p>Then the old woman stumbled in, they saw her feeling
her way over the doorstep with her foot and
closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>"'Tis lonely to be old and blind," said Lars Peter,
lashing his whip as usual.</p>

<p>Ditte heard nothing; she was sitting with her face in
one big smile. She was driving towards something
new; she had no thought for Granny just then.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_XIV" id="I_CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
At Home With Mother</span></h2>


<p>The rag and bone man's property&mdash;the Crow's
Nest&mdash;stood a little way back from the road,
and the piece up towards the road he had planted
with willows, partly to hide the half-ruined abode,
and partly to have material for making baskets during
the winter, when there was little business to be
done. The willows grew quickly, and already made a
beautiful place for playing hide and seek. He made
the house look as well as it could, with tar and whitewash,
but miserable looking it ever would be, leaking
and falling to pieces; it was the dream of Sörine's life,
that they should build a new dwelling-house up by the
road, using this as outhouse. The surroundings were
desolate and barren, and a long way from neighbors.
The view towards the northwest was shut off by
a big forest, and on the opposite side was the big lake,
which reflected all kinds of weather. On the dark
nights could be heard the quacking of the ducks in
the rushes on its banks, and on rainy days, boats would
glide like shadows over it, with a dark motionless figure
in the bow, the eel-fisher. He held his eel-fork slantingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
in front of him, prodded the water sleepily now
and then, and slid past. It was like a dream picture,
and the whole lake was in keeping. When Ditte felt
dull she would pretend that she ran down to the banks,
hid herself in the rushes, and dream herself home to
Granny. Or perhaps away to something still better;
something unknown, which was in store for her
somewhere or other. Ditte never doubted but
that there was something special in reserve for
her, so glorious that it was impossible even to
imagine it.</p>

<p>In her play too, her thoughts would go seawards,
and when her longing for Granny was too strong, she
would run round the corner of the house and gaze over
the wide expanse of water. Now she knew Granny's
true worth.</p>

<p>She had not yet been down to the sea; as a matter of
fact there was no time to play. At six o'clock in the
morning, the youngest babe made himself heard, as
regularly as clockwork, and she had to get up in a
hurry, take him from his mother and dress him. Lars
Peter would be at his morning jobs, if he had not
already gone to the beach for fish. When he was at
home, Sörine would get up with the children; but otherwise
she would take a longer nap, letting Ditte do the
heaviest part of the work for the day. Then her morning
duties would be left undone, the two animals bellowed
from the barn, the pigs squealed over their
empty trough, and the hens flocked together at the hen-house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
door waiting to be let out. Ditte soon found out
that her mother was more industrious when the father
was at home than when he was out; then she would trail
about the whole morning, her hair undone and an old
skirt over her nightdress, and a pair of down-trodden
shoes on her bare feet, while everything was allowed
to slide.</p>

<p>Ditte thought this was a topsy-turvy world. She
herself took her duties seriously, and had not yet been
sufficiently with grown-up people to learn to shirk work.
She washed and dressed the little ones. They were full
of life, mischievous and unmanageable, and she had
as much as she could do in looking after the three of
them. As soon as they saw an opportunity, the two
eldest would slip away from her, naked as they were;
then she had to tie up the youngest while she went after
them.</p>

<p>The days she went to school she felt as a relief. She
had just time to get the children ready, and eat her
porridge, before leaving. At the last moment her
mother would find something or other, which had to be
done, and she had to run the whole way.</p>

<p>She was often late, and was scolded for it, yet she
loved going to school. She enjoyed sitting quietly in
the warm schoolroom for hours at a stretch, resting
body and mind; the lessons were easy, and the schoolmaster
kind. He often let them run out for hours,
when he would work in his field, and it constantly happened
that the whole school helped him to gather in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
his corn or dig up his potatoes. This was a treat
indeed. The children were like a flock of screaming
birds, chattering, making fun and racing each other at
the work. And when they returned, the schoolmaster's
wife would give them coffee.</p>

<p>More than anything else Ditte loved the singing-class.
She had never heard any one but Granny sing,
and she only did it when she was spinning&mdash;to prevent
the thread from being uneven, and the wheel from
swinging, said she. It was always the same monotonous,
gliding melody; Ditte thought she had composed
it herself, because it was short or long according to
her mood.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster always closed the school with a
song, and the first time Ditte heard the full chorus, she
burst into tears with emotion. She put her head on the
desk, and howled. The schoolmaster stopped the singing
and came down to her.</p>

<p>"She must have been frightened," said the girls
nearest to her.</p>

<p>He comforted her, and she stopped crying. "Have
you never heard singing before, child?" he asked wonderingly,
when she had calmed down.</p>

<p>"Yes, the spinning-song," sniffed Ditte.</p>

<p>"Who sang it to you then?"</p>

<p>"Granny&mdash;&mdash;" Ditte suddenly stopped and began
to choke again, the thought of Granny was too much
for her. "Granny used to sing it when she was spinning,"
she managed at last to say.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"That must be a good old Granny, you have. Do
you love her?"</p>

<p>Ditte did not answer, but the face she turned to him
was like sunshine after the storm.</p>

<p>"Will you sing us the spinning-song?"</p>

<p>Ditte looked from the one to the other; the whole
class gazed breathlessly at her; she felt something
was expected of her. She threw a hasty glance at the
schoolmaster's face; then fixed her eyes on her desk
and began singing in a delicate little voice, which vibrated
with conflicting feelings; shyness, the solemnity
of the occasion, and sorrow at the thought of Granny,
who might now sit longing for her. Unconsciously she
moved one foot up and down as she sang, as one who
spins. One or two attempted to giggle, but one look
from the master silenced them.</p>

<p>When she had finished her song, there was stillness
for a few moments in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>"She thinks she's going to marry a prince," said
one of the girls.</p>

<p>"And that she probably will!" answered the schoolmaster.
"And then Granny can have all she wants,"
he added, stroking her hair.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Without knowing it, Ditte at one stroke had won
both the master's and the other children's liking. She
had sung to the whole class, quite alone, which none of
the others dared do. The schoolmaster liked her for
her fearlessness, and for some time shut his eyes whenever
she was late. But one day it was too much for
him, and he ordered her to stay in. Ditte began to cry.</p>

<p>"'Tis a shame," said the other girls, "she runs the
whole way, and she's whipped if she's late home. Her
mother stands every day at the corner of the house
waiting for her&mdash;she's so strict."</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to get hold of your mother," said
the schoolmaster. "This can't go on!" Ditte escaped
staying in, but was given a note to take home.</p>

<p>This having no effect, the schoolmaster went with
her home to speak to her mother. But Sörine refused
to take any responsibility. If the child arrived late at
school, it was simply because she loitered on the way.
Ditte listened to her in amazement; she could not make
out how her mother could look so undisturbed when
telling such untruths.</p>

<p>Ditte, to help herself, now began acting a lie too.
Each morning she seized the opportunity of putting the
little Swiss clock a quarter of an hour forward. It
worked quite well in the morning, so that she was in
time for school; but she would be late in arriving home.</p>

<p>"You're taking a quarter of an hour longer on the
road now," scolded her mother.</p>

<p>"We got out late today," lied Ditte, trying to copy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
her mother's unconcerned face, as she had seen it
when <i>she</i> lied. Her heart was in her mouth, but all
went well&mdash;wonderful to relate! How much wiser she
was now! During the day she quietly put the clock
back again.</p>

<p>One day, in the dusk, as she stood on the chair
putting the clock back, her mother came behind her.
Ditte threw herself down from the chair, quickly picking
up little Povl from the floor, where he was crawling;
in her fear, she tried to hide behind the little one.
But her mother tore him from her, and began thrashing
her.</p>

<p>Ditte had had a rap now and then, when she was
naughty, but this was the first time she had been really
whipped. She was like an animal, kicking and biting,
and shrieking, so that it was all her mother could do to
manage her. The three little ones' howls equaled hers.</p>

<p>When Sörine thought she had had enough, she
dragged her to the woodshed and locked her in. "Lie
there and howl, maybe it'll teach you not to try those
tricks again!" she shouted, and went in. She was so
out of breath that she had to sit down; that wicked child
had almost got the better of her.</p>

<p>Ditte, quite beyond herself, went on screaming and
kicking for some time. Her cries gradually quietened
down to a despairing wail of: "Granny, Granny!" It
was quite dark in the woodshed, and whenever she
called for Granny, she heard a comforting rustling
sound from the darkness at the back of the shed. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
gazed confidently towards it, and saw two green fire-balls
shining in the darkness, which came and went by
turns. Ditte was not afraid of the dark. "Puss, puss,"
she whispered. The fire-balls disappeared, and the
next moment she felt something soft touching her. And
now she broke down again, this caress was too much
for her, and she pitied herself intensely. Puss, little
puss! There was after all one who cared for her!
Now she would go home to Granny.</p>

<p>She got up, dazed and bruised, and felt her way to
the shutter. When Sörine thought that she had been
locked in long enough, and came to release her, she had
vanished.</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>Ditte ran into the darkness, sobbing; it was cold and
windy, and the rain was beating on her face. She
wore no knickers under her dress&mdash;these her mother
had taken for the little ones, together with the thick
woollen vest Granny had knitted for her&mdash;the wet edge
of her skirt cut her bare legs, which were swollen from
the lash of the cane. But the silent rain did her good.
Suddenly something flew up from beside her; she heard
the sound of rushes standing rustling in the water&mdash;and
knew that she had got away from the road. She
collapsed, and crawled into the undergrowth, and lay
shivering in a heap, like a sick puppy.</p>

<p>There she lay groaning without really having any
more pain; the cold had numbed her limbs and deadened
the smart. It was distress of soul which made her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
wince now and then; it was wrung by the emptiness and
meaninglessness of her existence. She needed soothing
hands, a mother first of all, who would fondle her&mdash;but
she got only hard words and blows from that
quarter. Yet it was expected that she should give what
she herself missed most of all&mdash;a mother's long-suffering
patience and tender care to the three tiresome little
ones, who were scarcely more helpless than she was.</p>

<p>Her black despair little by little gave place to numbness.
Hate and anger, feebleness and want, had all
fought in her mind and worn her out. The cold did the
rest, and she fell into a doze.</p>

<p>A peculiar, grinding, creaking and jolting noise came
from the road. Only one cart in all the world could
produce that sound. Ditte opened her eyes, and a feeling
of joy went through her&mdash;her father! She tried
to call, but no sound came, and each time she tried to
rise her legs gave way under her. She crawled up
with difficulty over the edge of the ditch, out into the
middle of the road, and there collapsed.</p>

<p>As the nag neared that spot, it stopped, threw up its
head, snorted, and refused to go on. Lars Peter
jumped down and ran to the horse's head to see what
was wrong; there he found Ditte, stiff with cold and
senseless.</p>

<p>Under his warm driving cape she came to herself
again, and life returned to the cold limbs. Lars Peter
thawed them one by one in his huge fists. Ditte lay
perfectly quiet in his arms; she could hear the beat of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
his great heart underneath his clothes, throb, throb!
Each beat was like the soft nosing of some animal,
and his deep voice sounded to her like an organ. His
big hands, which took hold of so much that was hard
and ugly, were the warmest she had ever known. Just
like Granny's cheek&mdash;the softest thing in all the world&mdash;were
they.</p>

<p>"Now we must get out and run a little," said the
father suddenly. Ditte was unwilling to move, she was
so warm and comfortable. There was no help for it
however. "We must get the blood to run again," said
he, lifting her out of the cart. Then they ran for some
time by the side of the nag, which threw out its big
hoofs in a jog-trot, so as not to be outdone.</p>

<p>"Shall we soon be home?" asked Ditte, when she
was in the cart again, well wrapped up.</p>

<p>"Oh-h, there's a bit left&mdash;you've run seven miles,
child! Now tell me what's the meaning of your running
about like this."</p>

<p>Then Ditte told him about the school, the injustice
she had had to bear, the whipping and everything. In
between there were growls from Lars Peter, as he
stamped his feet on the bottom of the cart&mdash;he could
hardly tolerate to listen to this tale. "But you won't
tell Sörine, will you?" she added with fear. "Mother,
I mean," she hastily corrected herself.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid," was all he said.</p>

<p>He was silent for the rest of the journey, and was
very slow in unharnessing; Ditte kept beside him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Sörine came out with a lantern and spoke to him,
but he did not answer. She cast a look of fear
at him and the child, hung up the lantern, and hurried
in.</p>

<p>Soon after he came in, holding Ditte by the hand, her
little hand shaking in his. His face was gray; in his
right hand was a thick stick. Sörine fled from his
glance; right under the clock; pressing herself into the
corner, gazing at them with perplexity.</p>

<p>"Ay, you may well gaze at us," said he, coming forward&mdash;"'tis
a child accusing you. What's to be done
about it?" He had seated himself under the lamp, and
lifting Ditte's frock, he carefully pressed his palm
against the blue swollen weals, which smarted with the
slightest touch. "It still hurts&mdash;you're good at thrashing!
let's see if you're equally good at healing. Come
and kiss the child, where you've struck her, a kiss for
each stroke!"</p>

<p>He sat waiting. "Well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sörine's face was full of disgust.</p>

<p>"Oh, you think your mouth's too good to kiss what
your hand's struck." He reached out for the stick.</p>

<p>Sörine had sunk down on the ground, she put out her
hands beseechingly. But he looked inexorably at her,
not at all like himself. "Well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sörine lingered a few moments longer, then on her
knees went and kissed the child's bruised limbs.</p>

<p>Ditte threw her arms violently round her mother's
neck. "Mother," said she.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>But Sörine got up and went out to get the supper.
She never looked at them the whole evening.</p>

<p>Lars Peter was his old self the next morning. He
woke Sörine with a kiss as usual, humming as he
dressed. Sörine still looked at him with malice, but he
pretended not to notice it. It was quite dark, and as he
sat eating his breakfast, with the lantern in front of
him on the table, he kept looking at the three little
ones, in bed. They were all in a heap&mdash;like young
birds. "When Povl has to join them, we'll have to
put two at each end," he said thoughtfully. "Better
still, if we could afford another bed."</p>

<p>There was no answer from Sörine.</p>

<p>When ready to leave, he bent over Ditte, who lay
like a little mother with the children in her arms.
"That's a good little girl, you've given us," said he,
straightening himself.</p>

<p>"She tells lies," answered Sörine from beside the
fireplace.</p>

<p>"Then it's because she's had to. My family's not
thought much of, Sörine&mdash;and maybe they don't deserve
it either. But never a hand was laid on us children,
I'll tell you. I remember plainly my father's
death-bed, how he looked at his hands, and said:
'These have dealt with much, but never has the rag
and bone man's hands been turned against the helpless!'
I'd like to say that when my time comes, and
I'd advise you to think of it too."</p>

<p>Then he drove away. Sörine put the lantern in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
window, to act as a guide to him, and crept back to
bed, but could not sleep. For the first time Lars Peter
had given her something to think of. She had found
that in him which she had never expected, something
strange which warned her to be careful. A decent soul,
she had always taken him for&mdash;just as the others. And
how awful he could be in his rage&mdash;it made her flesh
creep, when thinking of it. She certainly would be careful
not to come up against him again.</p>

Rain And Sunshine</span></h2>


<p>On the days when Ditte did not go to school,
there were thousands of things for her to do.
She had to look after the little ones, care for the
sheep and hens too, and gather nettles in a sack for
the pigs. At times Lars Peter came home early, having
been unlucky in selling his fish. Then she would sit
up with her parents until one or two o'clock in the
night, cleaning the fish, to prevent it spoiling. Sörine
was one of those people who fuss about without doing
much. She could not bear the child resting for a moment,
and drove her from one task to another. Often
when Ditte went to bed, she was so tired that she could
not sleep. Sörine had the miserable habit of making
the day unhappy for the children. She was rough with
them should they get in her way; and always left children's
tears like streams of water behind her. When
Ditte went to gather sticks, or pick berries, she always
dragged the little ones with her, so as not to leave
them to their mother's tender mercy. There were days
when Sörine was not quite so bad&mdash;she was never quite
happy and kind, but at other times she was almost mad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
with anger, and the only thing to do was to keep out
of her way. Then they would all hide, and only appear
when their father came home.</p>

<p>Sörine was careful not to strike Ditte, and sent her
off to school in good time&mdash;she had no wish to see
Lars Peter again as he was that evening. But she had
no love for the child, she wanted to get on in life;
it was her ambition to build a new dwelling-house, get
more land and animals&mdash;and be on the same footing
with the other women on the small farms round about.
The child was a blot on her. Whenever she looked at
Ditte, she would think: Because of that brat, all the
other women look down on me!</p>

<p>The child certainly was a good worker, even Sörine
grudgingly admitted it to Lars Peter. It was Ditte
who made butter, first in a bottle, which had to be
shaken, often by the hour, before the butter would
come&mdash;and now in the new churn. Sörine herself could
not stand the hard work of churning. Ditte gathered
berries and sold them in the market, ran errands,
fetched water and sticks, and looked after the sheep,
carrying fat little Povl wherever she went. He cried
if she left him behind, and she was quite crooked with
carrying him.</p>

<p>Autumn was the worst time for the children. It was
the herring season, and their father would stay down at
the fishing hamlet&mdash;often for a month at a time&mdash;helping
with the catch. Sörine was then difficult to get on
with; the only thing which kept her within bounds was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Ditte's threat of running away. There were not many
men left in the neighborhood in the autumn, and Sörine
went in daily dread of tramps. Should they knock at
the door in the evening, she would let Ditte answer it.</p>

<p>Ditte was not afraid. This and her cleverness gave
her moral power over her mother; she had no fear of
answering her back now. She was quicker with her
fingers than her mother, both in making baskets and
brooms, and did better work too.</p>

<p>What money they made in this way, Sörine had permission
to keep for herself. She never spent a penny
of it, but put it by, shilling by shilling, towards building
the new house. They must try hard to make
enough, so that Lars Peter could work at home instead
of hawking his goods on the road. As long as the
people had the right to call him rag and bone man, it
was natural they should show no respect. Land they
must have, and for this, money was necessary.</p>

<p>Money! money! That word was always in Sörine's
mind and humming in her ears. She scraped together
shilling after shilling, and yet the end was far from
being in sight, unless something unexpected happened.
And what could happen to shorten the wearisome way
to her goal, only one thing&mdash;that her mother should
die. She had really lived long enough and been a
burden to others. Sörine thought it was quite time she
departed, but no such luck.</p>

<p>It happened that Lars Peter returned one day in the
middle of the afternoon. The shabby turn-out could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
seen from afar. The cart rocked with every turn of
the wheels, creaking and groaning as it was dragged
along. It was as if all the parts of the cart spoke and
sang at once, and when the children heard the well-known
noise along the road, they would rush out, full
of excitement. The old nag, which grew more and
more like a wandering bag of bones, snorted and puffed,
and rumbled, as if all the winds from the four corners
of the earth were locked in its belly. And Lars Peter's
deep hum joined the happy chorus.</p>

<p>When the horse saw the little ones, it whinnied; Lars
Peter raised himself from his stooping position and
stopped singing, and the cart came to a standstill. He
lifted them up in the air, all three or four together in
a bunch, held them up to the sky for a moment, and
put them into the cart as carefully as if they were made
of glass. The one who had seen him first was allowed
to hold the reins.</p>

<p>When Lars Peter came home and found Sörine in
a temper and the house upside down, he was not disturbed
at all, but soon cheered them all up. He always
brought something home with him, peppermints for
the children, a new shawl for mother&mdash;and perhaps
love from Granny to Ditte, whispering it to her so
that Sörine could not hear. His good humor was infectious;
the children forgot their grievances, and even
Sörine had to laugh whether she wanted to or not.
And if the children were fond of him, so too were the
animals. They would welcome him with their different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
cries and run to meet him; he could let the pig out and
make it follow him in the funniest gallop round the
field.</p>

<p>However late he was in returning, and however tired,
he never went to bed without having first been the
round to see that the animals wanted for nothing.
Sörine easily forgot them and they were often hungry.
Then the hens flew down from their perch on hearing
his step, the pigs came out and grunted over their
trough, and a soft back rubbed itself up against his
legs&mdash;the cat.</p>

<p>Lars Peter brought joy with him home, and a happier
man than he could hardly be found for miles. He
loved his wife for what she was, more sharp than really
clever. He admired her for her firmness, and thought
her an exceedingly capable woman, and was truly thankful
for the children she gave him, for those he was
father to&mdash;and for Ditte. Perhaps if anything he
cared most for her.</p>

<p>Such was Lars Peter's nature that he began where
others ended. All his troubles had softened instead of
hardening him; his mind involuntarily turned to what
was neglected, perhaps it was because of this that
people thought nothing throve for him.</p>

<p>His ground was sour and sandy, none but he would
think of plowing it. No-one grudged him his wife,
and most of the animals he had saved from being killed,
on his trips round the farms. He could afford to be
happy with his possessions, thinking they were better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
than what others had. He was jealous of no-one, and
no exchange would tempt him.</p>

<p>On Sundays the horse had to rest, and it would not
do either to go on his rounds that day. Therefore Lars
Peter would creep up to the hayloft to have a sleep.
He would sleep on until late in the afternoon, having
had very little during the week, and Ditte had her work
cut out to keep the little ones from him; they made as
much noise as they possibly could, hoping to waken
him so that he might play with them, but Ditte watched
carefully, that he had his sleep in peace.</p>

<p>Twice a year they all drove to the market at
Hilleröd, on top of the loaded cart. The children were
put into the baskets which were stacked in the back
of the cart, the brooms hung over the sides, under the
seat were baskets of butter and eggs, and in front&mdash;under
Lars' and Sörine's feet, were a couple of sheep
tied up. These were the great events of the year, from
which everything was dated.</p>




<hr class="chapbreak" />

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_XVI" id="I_CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
Poor Granny</span></h2>


<p>On rare occasions Ditte was permitted to go and
stay with Granny for a few days. It was the
father who managed this, and he arranged his round
so that he could either bring or fetch her home.</p>

<p>Granny was always in bed when she arrived&mdash;she
never got up now. "Why should I trudge on, when
you're not here? If I stay in bed, then sometimes kind
folks remember me and bring me a little food and
clean up for me. Oh, dear! 'twould be much better
to die; nobody wants me," she complained. But she
got up all the same, and put on water for the coffee;
Ditte cleaned the room, which was in a deplorable condition,
and they enjoyed themselves together.</p>

<p>When the time was up and Ditte had to go, the old
woman cried. Ditte stood outside listening to her
wailings; she held on to the doorpost trying to pull
herself together. She <i>had</i> to go home, and began
running with closed eyes the first part of the way, until
she could hear Granny's cries no longer, then&mdash;&mdash;But
she got more and more sick at heart, and knew no
more, until she found herself with her arms round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Granny's neck. "I'm allowed to stay until tomorrow,"
said she.</p>

<p>"You're not playing tricks, child?" said the old
woman anxiously. "For then Sörine'll be angry. Ay,
ay," said she shortly afterwards, "stay until tomorrow
then. The Lord'll make it all right for you&mdash;for the
sake of your good heart. We don't have much chance
of seeing each other, we two."</p>

<p>The next day it was no better; Maren had not the
strength to send the child away. There was so much
to tell her, and what was one day after the accumulation
of months of sorrow and longing? And Ditte
listened seriously to all her woes; she understood now
what sorrow and longing meant. "You've quite
changed," said Granny. "I notice it from the way
you listen to me. If only the time would pass quickly
so that you might go out to service."</p>

<p>And one day it was all over; Lars Peter had come
to fetch her. "You'd better come home now," said
he, wrapping her up, "the little ones are crying for
you."</p>

<p>"Ay, you're not to be feared," said old Maren.
"But it seems like Sörine might be kinder to her."</p>

<p>"I think it's better now&mdash;and the little ones are fond
of her. She's quite a little mother to them."</p>

<p>Yes, there were the children! Ditte's heart warmed
at the thought of them. They had gained her affection
in their own peculiar way; by adding burdens to her
little life they had wound themselves round her heart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"How's Povl?" asked she, when they had driven
over the big hill, and Granny's hut was out of sight.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, he's always crying when you're
not at home," said the father quietly.</p>

<p>Ditte knew this. He was cutting his teeth just now,
and needed nursing, his cheeks were red with fever, and
his mouth hot and swollen. He would hang on to his
mother's skirt, only to be brushed impatiently aside,
and would fall and hurt himself. Who then was there
to take him on their knee and comfort him? It was
like an accusation to Ditte's big heart; she was sorry
she had deserted him, and longed to have him in her
arms again. It hurt her back to carry him&mdash;yes, and
the schoolmaster scolded her for stooping. "It's your
own fault," the mother would say; "stop dragging that
big child about! He can walk if he likes, he can."
But when he was in pain and cried, Ditte knew all too
well from her own experience the child's need of being
held against a beating heart. She still had that longing
herself, though a mother's care had never been offered
her.</p>

<p>Sörine was cross when Lars Peter returned with
Ditte, and ignored her for several days. But at last
curiosity got the upper hand. "How's the old woman&mdash;is
she worse?" asked she.</p>

<p>Ditte, who thought her mother asked out of sympathy,
gave full details of the miserable condition that
Granny was in. "She's always in bed, and only gets
food when any one takes it to her."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then she can't last much longer," thought the
mother.</p>

<p>At this Ditte began to cry. Then her mother scolded
her:</p>

<p>"Stupid girl, there's nothing to cry for. Old folks
can't live on forever, being a burden to others.
And when Granny dies we'll get a new dwelling-house."</p>

<p>"No, 'cause Granny says, what comes from the
house is to be divided equally. And the rest&mdash;&mdash;"
Ditte broke off suddenly.</p>

<p>"What rest?" Sörine bent forward with distended
nostrils.</p>

<p>But Ditte closed her lips firmly. Granny had strictly
forbidden her to mention the subject&mdash;and here she
had almost let it out.</p>

<p>"Stupid girl! don't you suppose I know you're thinking
of the two hundred crowns that was paid for you?
What's to be done with it?"</p>

<p>Ditte looked with suspicion at her mother. "I'm
to have it," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Then the old woman should let us keep it for you,
instead of hanging on to it herself," said Sörine.</p>

<p>Ditte was terrified. That was exactly what Granny
was afraid of, that Sörine should get hold of it.
"Granny has hidden it safely," said she.</p>

<p>"Oh, has she, and where?&mdash;in the eiderdown of
course!"</p>

<p>"No!" Ditte assured her, shaking her head vehemently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
But any one could see that was where it was
hidden.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's lucky, for that eiderdown I'm going to
fetch some day. That you can tell Granny, with my
love, next time you see her. Each of my sisters when
they married was given an eiderdown, and I claim mine
too."</p>

<p>"Granny only has one eiderdown!" Ditte protested&mdash;perhaps
for the twentieth time.</p>

<p>"Then she'll just have to take one of her many
under-quilts. She lies propped up nearly to the ceiling,
with all those bedclothes."</p>

<p>Yes, Granny's bed was soft, Ditte knew that better
than any one else. Granny's bedclothes were heavy,
and yet warmer than anything else in the whole world,
and there was a straw mat against the wall. It had
been so cosy and comfortable sleeping with Granny.</p>

<p>Ditte was small for her age, all the hardships she
had endured had stunted her growth. But her mind
was above the average; she was thoughtful by nature,
and her life had taught her not to shirk, but to take up
her burden. She had none of the carelessness of childhood,
but was full of forethought and troubles. She
<i>had</i> to worry&mdash;for her little sisters and brothers the
few days she was with Granny, and for Granny all the
time she was not with her.</p>

<p>As a punishment, for having prolonged her visit
to Granny without permission, Sörine for a long time
refused to let her go again. Then Ditte went about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
thinking of the old woman, worrying herself into a
morbid self-reproach; most of all at night, when she
could not sleep for cold, would her sorrows overwhelm
her, and she would bury her head in the eiderdown, so
that her mother should not hear her sobs.</p>

<p>She would remember all the sweet ways of the old
woman, and bitterly repent the tricks and mischief she
had played upon her. This was her punishment; she
had repaid Granny badly for all her care, and now she
was alone and forsaken. She had never been really
good to the old woman; she would willingly be so now&mdash;but
it was too late! There were hundreds of ways
of making Granny happy, and Ditte knew them all, but
she had been a horrid, lazy girl. If she could only go
back now, she certainly would see that Granny always
had a lump of sugar for her second cup of coffee&mdash;instead
of stealing it herself. And she would remember
every evening to heat the stone, and put it at the foot of
the bed, so Granny's feet should not be cold. "You've
forgotten the stone again," said Granny almost every
night, "my feet are like ice. And what are yours like?
Why, they're quite cold, child." Then Granny would
rub the child's feet until they were warm; but nothing
was done to her own&mdash;it was all so hopeless to think
of it now.</p>

<p>She thought, if she only promised to be better in
the future, something must happen to take her back to
Granny again. But nothing did happen! And one
day she could stand it no longer, and set off running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
over the fields. Sörine wanted her brought home at
once; but Lars Peter took it more calmly.</p>

<p>"Just wait a few days," said he, "'tis a long time
since she's seen the old woman." And he arranged his
round so that Ditte could spend a few days with her
grandmother.</p>

<p>"Bring back the eiderdown with you," said Sörine.
"It's cold now, and it'll be useful for the children."</p>

<p>"We'll see about it," answered Lars Peter. When
she got a thing into her head, she would nag on and on
about it, so that she would have driven most people
mad. But Lars Peter did not belong to the family of
Man; all her haggling had no effect on his good-natured
stubbornness.</p>

When The Cat's Away</span></h2>


<p>Ditte was awakened by the sound of iron being
struck, and opened her eyes. The smoking
lamp stood on the table, and in front of the fire was
her mother hammering a ring off the kettle with a
poker. She was not yet dressed; the flames from the
fire flickered over her untidy red hair and naked throat.
Ditte hastily closed her eyes again, so that her mother
should not discover that she was awake. The room
was cold, and through the window-panes could be seen
the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>Then her father came tramping in with the lantern,
which he put out and hung it up behind the door. He
was already dressed, and had been out doing his morning
jobs. There was a smell of coffee in the room.
"Ah!" said he, seating himself by the table. Ditte
peeped out at him; when he was there, there was no
fear of being turned out of bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are, little wagtail," said he. "Go
to sleep again, it's only five o'clock&mdash;-but maybe you're
thinking of a cup of coffee in bed?"</p>

<p>Ditte glanced at her mother, who stood with her
back to her. Then she nodded her head eagerly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Lars Peter drank half of his coffee, put some more
sugar in the cup, and handed it to the child.</p>

<p>Sörine was dressing by the fireplace. "Now keep
quiet," said she, "while I tell you what to do. There's
flour and milk for you to make pancakes for dinner;
but don't dare to put an egg in."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, what's an egg or two," Lars Peter
tried to say.</p>

<p>"You leave the housekeeping to me," answered
Sörine, "and you'd better get up at once before we
leave, and begin work."</p>

<p>"What's the good of that?" said Lars Peter again.
"Leave the children in bed till it's daylight. I've fed
the animals, and it's no good wasting oil."</p>

<p>This last appealed to Sörine. "Very well, then, but
be careful with the fire&mdash;and don't use too much sugar."</p>

<p>Then they drove away. Lars Peter was going to the
shore to fetch fish as usual, but would first drive Sörine
into town, where she would dispose of the month's collection
of butter and eggs, and buy in what could not
be got from the grocer in the hamlet. Ditte listened to
the cart until she dropped asleep again.</p>

<p>When it was daylight, she got up and lit the fire
again. The others wanted to get up too, but by promising
them coffee instead of their usual porridge and milk
she kept them in bed until she had tidied up the room.
They got permission to crawl over to their parents'
bed, and thoroughly enjoyed themselves there, while
Ditte put wet sand on the floor, and swept it. Kristian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
who was now five years old, told stories in a deep voice
of a dreadful cat that went about the fields eating up
all the moo-cows; the two little ones lay across him,
their eyes fixed on his lips, and breathless with excitement.
They could see it quite plainly&mdash;the pussy-cat,
the moo-cow and everything&mdash;and little Povl, out of
sheer eagerness to hurry up the events, put his fat little
hand right down Kristian's throat. Ditte went about
her duties smiling in her old-fashioned way at their
childish talk. She looked very mysterious as she gave
them their coffee; and when the time came for them
to be dressed, the surprise came out. "Oh, we're going
to have our best clothes on&mdash;hip, hip, hooray!" shouted
Kristian, beginning to jump up and down on the
bed. Ditte smacked him, he was spoiling the bedclothes!</p>

<p>"If you'll be really good and not tell any one, I'll
take you out for a drive," said Ditte, dressing them
in their best clothes. These were of many colors, their
mother having made them from odd scraps of material,
taken from the rag and bone man's cart.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;to the market?" shouted Kristian, beginning
to jump again.</p>

<p>"No, to the forest," said the little sister, stroking
Ditte's cheeks beseechingly with her dirty little hands,
which were blue with cold. She had seen it from afar,
and longed to go there.</p>

<p>"Yes, to the forest. But you must be good; it's a
long way."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"May we tell pussy?" Söster looked at Ditte with
her big expressive eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, and papa," Kristian joined in with.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not any one else," Ditte impressed upon
them. "Now remember that!"</p>

<p>The two little ones were put into the wheelbarrow,
and Kristian held on to the side, and thus they set off.
There was snow everywhere, the bushes were weighted
down with it, and on the cart track the ice cracked under
the wheel. It was all so jolly, the black crows, the
magpies which screamed at them from the thorn-bushes,
and the rime which suddenly dropped from the trees,
right on to their heads.</p>

<p>It was three miles to the forest, but Ditte was used to
much longer distances, and counted this as nothing.
Kristian and Söster took turns in walking, Povl wanted
to walk in the snow too, but was told to stay where he
was and be good.</p>

<p>All went well until they had got halfway. Then the
little ones began to tire of it, asking impatiently for
the forest. They were cold, and Ditte had to stop
every other moment to rub their fingers. The sun had
melted the snow, making it dirty and heavy under foot,
and she herself was getting tired. She tried to cheer
them up, and trailed on a little further; but outside the
bailiff's farm they all came to a hopeless standstill. A
big fierce dog thought their hesitation suspicious and
barred their way.</p>

<p>Per Nielsen came out on the porch to see why the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
dog barked so furiously; he at once saw what had happened,
and took the children indoors. It was dinner-time,
the wife was in the kitchen frying bacon and
apples together. It smelt delicious. She thawed their
frozen fingers in cold water; when they were all right
again, all three stood round the fire. Ditte tried to get
them away, but they were hungry.</p>

<p>"You shall have some too," said the bailiff's wife,
"but sit down on that bench and be good; you're in my
way." They were each given a piece of cake, and then
seated at the scoured table. They had never been out
before, their eyes went greedily from one thing to
another, as they were eating; on the walls hung copperware,
which shone like the sun, and on the fire was
a big bright copper kettle with a cover to the spout.
It was like a huge hen sitting on eggs.</p>

<p>When they had finished their meal, Per Nielsen took
them out and showed them the little pigs, lying like rolls
of sausages round the mother. Then they went into
the house again, and the wife gave them apples and
cakes, but the best of all came last, when Per Nielsen
harnessed the beautiful spring-cart to drive them home.
The wheelbarrow was put in the back, so that too got a
drive. The little ones laughed so much that it caught
in their throats.</p>

<p>"Stupid children, coming out like that all alone,"
said the bailiff's wife, as she stood wrapping them up.
"Fortunately 'twas more good luck than management
that you came here." And they all agreed that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
return to the Crow's Nest was much grander than the
set-off.</p>

<p>The trip had been glorious, but now there was work
to be done. The mother had not taken picnics into
account, and had put a large bundle of rags out on the
threshing-floor to be sorted, all the wool to be separated
from the cotton. Kristian and Söster could give a helping
hand if they liked; but they would not be serious
today. They were excited by the trip, and threw the
rags at each other's heads. "Now, you mustn't fight,"
repeated Ditte every minute, but it did no good.</p>

<p>When darkness fell, they had only half finished.
Ditte fetched the little lamp, in which they used half
oil and half petroleum, and went on working; she
cried despairingly when she found that they could not
finish by the time her parents would return. At the
sight of her tears the children became serious, and for
a while the work went on briskly. But soon they were
on the floor again chasing each other; and by accident
Kristian kicked the lamp, which fell down and broke.
This put an end to their wildness; the darkness fixed
them to the spot; they dared not move. "Ditte take
me," came wailingly from each corner.</p>

<p>Ditte opened the trap-door. "Find your own way
out!" said she harshly, fumbling about for Povl, who
was sleeping on a bundle of rags; she was angry.
"Now you shall go to bed for punishment," said she.</p>

<p>Kristian was sobbing all the time. "Don't let
mother whip me, don't let her!" he said over and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
over again. He put his arms round Ditte's neck as if
seeking refuge there. And this put an end to her anger.</p>

<p>When she had lit the lantern she helped them to
undress. "Now if you'll be good and go straight to
sleep, then Ditte will run to the store and buy a lamp."
She dared not leave the children with the light burning,
and put it out before she left. As a rule they were
afraid of being left alone in the dark; but under the
present conditions it was no good making a fuss.</p>

<p>Ditte had a sixpence! Granny had given it to her
once in their well-to-do-days, and she had kept it faithfully
through all temptations up to now. It was to have
bought her so many beautiful things, and now it had to
go&mdash;to save little Kristian from a whipping. Slowly
she kneeled down in front of the hole at the foot of
the wall where it was hidden, and took the stone away;
it really hurt her to do it. Then she got up and ran
off to the store as quickly as she could&mdash;before she
could repent.</p>

<p>On her return the little ones were asleep. She lit the
lantern and began to peel off the withered leaves from
the birches which were to be made into brooms; she
was tired after the long eventful day, but could not
idle. The strong fragrance from the birches was penetrating,
and she fell asleep over her work. Thus her
parents found her.</p>

<p>Sörine's sharp eyes soon saw that everything was
not as it should be. "Why've you got the lantern lit?"
asked she, as she unbuttoned her coat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Ditte had to own up, "but I've bought another!"
she hastened to add.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;and where is it?" said the mother, looking
round the room.</p>

<p>The next moment Sörine stood in the doorway.
"Who gave you permission to get things on credit?"
asked she.</p>

<p>"I bought it with my own money," Ditte whispered.</p>

<p>Own money&mdash;then began a cross-examination, which
looked as if it would never end. Lars Peter had to
interfere.</p>

<p>There was no fire in the room, so they went early
to bed; Ditte had forgotten the fire. "She's had
enough to do," said Lars Peter excusingly. And
Sörine had nothing to say&mdash;she had no objection when
it meant saving.</p>

<p>There was a hard frost. Ditte was cold and could
not sleep, she lay gazing at her breath, which showed
white, and listening to the crackling of the frost on the
walls. Outside it was moonlight, and the beams shone
coldly over the floor and the chair with the children's
clothes. If she lifted her head, she could peep out
through the cracks in the wall, catching glimpses of
the white landscape; the cold blew in her face.</p>

<p>The room got colder and colder. She had to lie with
one arm outstretched, holding the eiderdown over the
others, and the cold nipped her shoulders. Söster began
to be restless, she was the most thin-blooded of the
three and felt the cold. It was an eiderdown which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
was little else than a thick cover, the feathers having
disappeared, and those they got when killing poultry
were too good to be used&mdash;the mother wanted them
turned into money.</p>

<p>Now Povl began to whimper. Ditte took the children's
clothes from the chair and spread them over the
bed. From their parents' bed came the mother's voice.
"You're to be quiet," said she. The father got up,
fetched his driving-cape, and spread it over them; it
was heavy with dust and dirt, but it warmed them!</p>

<p>"'Tis dreadful the way the wind blows through
these walls," said he when again in bed; "the air's
like ice in the room! I must try to get some planks to
patch up the walls."</p>

<p>"You'd better be thinking of building; this rotten
old case isn't worth patching up."</p>

<p>Lars Peter laughed: "Ay, that's all very well; but
where's the money to come from?"</p>

<p>"We've got a little. And then the old woman'll die
soon&mdash;I can feel it in my bones."</p>

<p>Ditte's heart began to jump&mdash;was Granny going to
die? Her mother had said it so decidedly. She listened
breathlessly to the conversation.</p>

<p>"And what of that?" she heard her father say,
"that won't alter matters."</p>

<p>"I believe the old woman's got more than we think,"
answered Sörine in a low voice. "Are you asleep,
Ditte?" she called out, raising herself on her elbow
listening. Ditte lay perfectly still.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know?" Sörine began again, "I'm sure the
old woman has sewn the money up in the quilt. That's
why she won't part with it."</p>

<p>Lars Peter yawned loudly; "What money?" It
could be gathered from the sound of his voice, that he
wanted to sleep now.</p>

<p>"The two hundred crowns, of course."</p>

<p>"What's that to do with us?"</p>

<p>"Isn't she my mother? But the money'll go to the
child, and aren't we the proper ones to look after it for
her. If the old woman dies and there's an auction&mdash;there'll
be good bids for it, and whoever buys the quilt'll
get the two hundred crowns as well. You'd better go
over and have a talk with her, and make her leave
everything to us."</p>

<p>"Why not you?" said Lars Peter, and turned round
towards the wall.</p>

<p>Then everything was quiet. Ditte lay in a heap, with
hands pressed against mouth, and her little heart throbbing
with fear; she almost screamed with anxiety. Perhaps
Granny would die in the night! It was some time
since she had visited her, and she had an overpowering
longing for Granny.</p>

<p>She crept out of bed and put on her shoes.</p>

<p>Her mother raised herself; "Where're you going?"</p>

<p>"Just going outside," answered Ditte faintly.</p>

<p>"Put a skirt on, it's very cold," said Lars Peter&mdash;"we
might just as well have kept the new piece of furniture
in here," he growled shortly afterwards.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>What a long time the child took&mdash;Lars Peter got
up and peeped out. He caught sight of her far down
the moonlit road. Hastily throwing on some clothes,
he rushed after her. He could see her ahead, tearing
off for all she was worth. He ran and shouted, ran and
shouted, his heavy wooden shoes echoing on the road.
But the distance between them only increased; at last
she disappeared altogether from view. He stood a
little longer shouting; his voice resounded in the stillness
of the night; and then turned round and went home.</p>

<p>Ditte tore on through the moonlit country. The
road was as hard as stone, and the ice cut through her
cloth shoes; from bog and ditch came the sound, crack,
crack, crack; and the sea boomed on the shore. But
Ditte did not feel the cold, her heart was beating wildly.
Granny's dying, Granny's dying! went continuously
through her mind.</p>

<p>By midnight she had reached the end of her journey,
she was almost dropping with fatigue. She stopped at
the corner of the house to gain breath; from inside
could be heard Granny's hacking cough. "I'm coming,
Granny!" she cried, tapping on the window, sobbing
with joy.</p>

<p>"How cold you are, child!" said the old woman,
when they were both under the eiderdown. "Your
feet are like lumps of ice&mdash;warm them on me." Ditte
nestled in to her, and lay there quietly.</p>

<p>"Granny! mother knows you've hidden the money in
the eiderdown," she said suddenly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guessed that, my child. Feel!" The old woman
guided Ditte's hand to her breast, where a little packet
was hidden. "Here 'tis, Maren can take care of what's
trusted to her. Ay, ay, 'tis <a class="corr" name="TC_3" id="TC_3" title="said">sad</a> to be like us two, no-one
to care for us, and always in the way&mdash;to our own folks
most of all. They can't make much use of you yet,
and they're finished with me&mdash;I'm worn out. That's
how it is."</p>

<p>Ditte listened to the old woman's talk. It hummed
in her ears and gave her a feeling of security. She
was now comfortable and warm, and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>But old Maren for some time continued pouring out
her grievances against existence.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_XVIII" id="I_CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
The Raven Flies By Night</span></h2>


<p>It was a hard winter. All through December the
snow swept the fields, drifting into the willows in
front of the Crow's Nest, the only place in the
neighborhood where a little shelter was to be found.</p>

<p>The lake was entirely frozen; one could walk across
it from shore to shore. When there was a moon, the
rag and bone man would go down and with his wooden
shoe break the ice round the seagulls and wild ducks,
which were frozen in the lake, and then carry them
home under his snow-covered cape. He would put
them on the peat beside the fireplace, where for days
they stood on one leg gazing sickly into the embers, until
Sörine at last took them into the kitchen and wrung
their necks.</p>

<p>In spite of there being a fire day and night, the cold
was felt intensely in the Crow's Nest; it was impossible
to heat the room. Sörine, with the bread-knife, stuffed
old rags into the cracks in the wall; but one day when
doing this, a big piece of the wall collapsed. She filled
up the hole with the eiderdown, and when Lars Peter
came home at night, he patched it up and nailed planks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
across to keep it in place. The roof was not up too
much either; the rats and house-martens had worked
havoc in it, so that it was like a sieve, and the snow
drifted into the loft. It was all bad.</p>

<p>Every day Sörine tried to rouse Lars Peter to do
something.</p>

<p>But what could he do? "I can't work harder than
I do, and steal I won't," said he.</p>

<p>"What do the others do, who live in a pretty and
comfortable house?"</p>

<p>Yes, how did other people manage? Lars Peter
could not imagine. He had never envied any one, nor
drawn comparisons, so had never faced the question
before.</p>

<p>"You toil and toil, but never get any further, that
I can see," Sörine continued.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that?" Lars Peter looked at
her with surprise and sorrow.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. What have you done? Aren't we just
where we started?"</p>

<p>Lars Peter bent his head on hearing her hard words.
But it was all quite true; except for strict necessities,
they had never money to spare.</p>

<p>"There's so much wanted, and everything's so
dear," said he excusingly. "There's no trade either!
We must just have patience, till it comes round
again."</p>

<p>"You with your patience and patience&mdash;maybe we
can live on your being patient and content? D'you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
know why folk call this the Crow's Nest? Because
nothing thrives for us, they say."</p>

<p>Lars Peter took his big hat from the nail behind
the door and went out. He was depressed, and sought
comfort with the animals; they and the children he
understood, but grown-up people he could not. After
all, there must be something lacking in him, since all
thought him a peculiar fellow, just because he was
happy and patient.</p>

<p>As soon as he had left the kitchen, the nag recognized
his footstep, and welcomed him with a whinny.
He went into the stall and stroked its back; it was like
a wreck lying keel upwards. It certainly was a skeleton,
and could not be called handsome. People smiled when
they saw the two of them coming along the road&mdash;he
knew it quite well! But they had shared bad and good
together, and the nag was not particular; it took everything
as it came, just as he did.</p>

<p>Lars Peter had never cared for other people's
opinion; but now his existence was shaken, and it was
necessary to defend himself and his own. In the stall
beside the horse lay the cow. True enough, if taken to
market now it would not fetch much; it was weak on
its legs and preferred to lie down. But with spring,
when it got out to grass, this would right itself. And it
was a good cow for a small family like his; it did not
give much milk at a time, but to make up for it gave milk
all the year round. And rich milk too! When uncomplimentary
remarks were made about it, Lars Peter would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
chaffingly declare that he could skim the milk three
times, and then there was nothing but cream left. He
was very fond of it, and more so for the good milk it
had given the little ones.</p>

<p>One corner of the outhouse was boarded off for the
pig. It too had heard him, and stood waiting for him
to come and scratch its neck. It suffered from intestinal
hernia; it had been given to Lars Peter by a farmer
who wanted to get rid of it. It was not a pretty sight,
but under the circumstances had thriven well, he
thought, and would taste all right when salted. Perhaps
it was this Sörine wanted?</p>

<p>The snow lay deep on the fields, but he recognized
every landmark through the white covering. It was
sandy soil, and yielded poor crops, yet for all that Lars
Peter was fond of it. To him it was like a face with
dear living features, and he would no more criticize it
than he would his own mother. He stood at the door
of the barn gazing lingeringly at his land. He was not
happy&mdash;as he usually was on Sundays when he went
about looking at his possessions. Today he could
understand nothing!</p>

<p>Every day Sörine would return to the same subject,
with some new proposal. They would buy her mother's
house and move over there; the beams were of oak,
and the hut would last for many years. Or they would
take her as a pensioner, while there was time&mdash;in return
for getting all she owned. Her thoughts were ever with
her mother and her possessions. "Suppose she goes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
some one else as a pensioner, and leaves everything to
them! or fritters away Ditte's two hundred crowns!"
said she. "She's in her second childhood!"</p>

<p>She was mad on the subject, but Lars Peter let her
talk on.</p>

<p>"Isn't it true, Ditte, that Granny would be much
better with us?" Sörine would continue. She quite
expected the child to agree with her, crazy as she was
over her grandmother.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Ditte sullenly. Her
mother lately had done her best to get her over to her
side, but Ditte was suspicious of her. She would love
to be with Granny again, but not in that way. She
would only be treated badly. Ditte had no faith in her
mother's care. It was more for her own wicked ends
than for daughterly love, Granny herself had said.</p>

<p>Sörine was beyond comprehension. One morning
she would declare that before long they would hear
sad news about Granny, because she had heard the
raven screaming in the willows during the night. "I'd
better go over and see her," said she.</p>

<p>"Ay, that's right, you go," answered Lars Peter.
"I'll drive you over. After all, the nag and I have
nothing to do."</p>

<p>But Sörine wouldn't hear of it. "You've your own
work to do at home," said she. However, she did not
get off that day&mdash;something or other prevented her.
She had grown very restless.</p>

<p>The next morning she was unusually friendly to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
children. "I'll tell you something, Granny will soon be
coming here&mdash;I dreamed it last night," said she, as she
helped Ditte to dress them. "She can have the alcove,
and father and I'll move into the little room. And then
you won't be cold any longer."</p>

<p>"But yesterday you said that Granny was going to
die soon," objected Ditte.</p>

<p>"Ay, but that was only nonsense. Hurry up home
from school. I've some shopping to do, and likely
won't be home till late." She put sugar on the bread
Ditte took to school, and sent her off in good time.</p>

<p>Ditte set out, with satchel hanging from her arm,
and her hands rolled up in the ends of her muffler. The
father had driven away early, and she followed the
wheel-tracks for some distance, and amused herself by
stepping in the old nag's footprints. Then the trail
turned towards the sea.</p>

<p>She could not follow the lessons today, she was perplexed
in mind. Her mother's friendliness had roused
her suspicions. It was so contrary to the conviction
which the child from long experience had formed as to
her mother's disposition. Perhaps she was not such
a bad mother when it came to the point. The sugar on
the bread almost melted Ditte's heart.</p>

<p>But at the end of the school hour, a fearful anxiety
overwhelmed her; her heart began to flutter like a
captured bird, and she pressed her hand against her
mouth, to keep herself from screaming aloud. When
leaving the school, she started running towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Naze. "That's the wrong way, Ditte!" shouted the
girls she used to go home with. But she only ran on.</p>

<p>It was thick with snow, and the air was still and
heavy-laden. It had been like twilight all day long.
As she neared the hill above the hut on the Naze, darkness
began to fall. She had run all the way and only
stopped at the corner of the house, to get her breath.
There was a humming in her ears, and through the
hum she heard angry voices: Granny's crying, and her
mother's hard and merciless.</p>

<p>She was about to tap on the window-pane, but hesitated,
her mother's voice made her creep with fear.
She shivered as she crept round the house towards the
woodshed, opened the door, and stood in the kitchen,
listening breathlessly. Her mother's voice drowned
Granny's; it had often forced Ditte to her knees, but
so frightful she had never heard it before. She was
stiff with fear, and she had to squat on the ground,
shivering with cold.</p>

<p>Through the keyhole she caught a glimpse of her
mother's big body standing beside the alcove. She
was bent over it, and from the movement of her back,
it could be seen that she had got hold of the old woman.
Granny was defending herself.</p>

<p>"Come out with it at once," Sörine shouted hoarsely.
"Or I'll pull you out of bed."</p>

<p>"I'll call for some one," groaned Granny, hammering
on the wall.</p>

<p>"Call for help if you like," ridiculed Sörine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
"there's no-one to hear you. Maybe you've got it in
the eiderdown, since you hold it so tightly."</p>

<p>"Oh, hold your mouth, you thief," moaned Granny.
Suddenly there was a scream, Sörine must have got hold
of the packet on the old woman's breast.</p>

<p>Ditte jumped in and lifted the latch. "Granny,"
she shrieked, but she was not heard in the fearful noise.
They fought, Granny's screams were like those of
a dying animal. "I'll make you shut up, you witch!"
shouted Sörine, and the old woman's scream died away
to an uncanny rattle; Ditte wanted to assist her grandmother,
but could not move, and suddenly fell unconscious
to the ground. When she came to herself again,
she was lying face downwards on the floor; her forehead
hurt. She stumbled to her feet. The door stood
open, and her mother had gone. Large white flakes
of snow came floating in, showing white in the darkness.</p>

<p>Ditte's first thought was that it would be cold for
Granny. She closed the door and went towards the
bed. Old Maren lay crouched together among the
untidy bedclothes. "Granny," called Ditte and crying
groped for the sunken face. "It's only me, dear little
Granny."</p>

<p>She took the old woman's face entreatingly between
her thin toil-worn hands, crying over it for a while; then
undressed herself and crept into bed beside her. She
had once heard Granny say about some one she had
been called to: "There is nothing to be done for him,
he's quite cold!" And she was obsessed with that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
thought, Granny must not be allowed to get cold, or she
would have no Granny left. She crept close to the
body, and worn out by tears and exhaustion soon fell
asleep.</p>

<p>Towards morning she woke feeling cold; Granny
was dead and cold. Suddenly she understood the awfulness
of it all, and hurrying into her clothes, she fled.</p>

<p>She ran across the fields in the direction of home,
but when she reached the road leading to the sea, she
went along it to Per Nielsen's farm. There they picked
her up, benumbed with misery. "Granny's dead!"
she broke out over and over again, looking from one
to the other with terror in her eyes. That was all they
could get out of her. When they proposed taking her
home to the Crow's Nest, she began to scream, so they
put her to bed, to rest.</p>

<p>When she woke later in the day, Per Nielsen came in
to her. "Well, I suppose you'd better be thinking of
getting home," said he. "I'll go with you."</p>

<p>Ditte gazed at him with fear in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of your stepfather?" asked he.
She did not answer. The wife came in.</p>

<p>"I don't know what we're to do," said he, "she's
afraid to go home. The stepfather can't be very good
to her."</p>

<p>Ditte turned sharply towards him. "I want to go
home to Lars Peter," she said, sobbing.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="I_CHAPTER_XIX" id="I_CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
Ill Luck Follows The Raven's Call</span></h2>


<p>On receiving information of old Maren's death,
four of her children assembled at the hut on
the Naze, to look after their own interests, and
watch that no-one ran off with anything. The other
four on the other side of the globe, could of course
not be there.</p>

<p>There was no money&mdash;not as much as a farthing was
to be found, in spite of their searching, and the splitting
up of the eiderdown&mdash;and the house was mortgaged
up to the hilt. They then agreed to give Sörine
and her husband what little there was, on condition that
they provided the funeral. On this occasion, Sörine did
not spare money, she wanted the funeral to be talked
about. Old Maren was put into the ground with more
grandeur than she had lived.</p>

<p>Ditte was at the funeral&mdash;naturally, as she was the
only one who had ever cared for the dead woman. But
in the churchyard she so lost control over herself, that
Lars Peter had to take her aside, to prevent her disturbing
the parson. She had such strong feelings,
every one thought.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>But in this respect Ditte changed entirely. After
Granny's death, she seemed to quieten. She went about
doing her work, was not particularly lively, but not depressed
either. Lars Peter observed that she and her
mother quarreled no longer. This was a pleasant step
in the right direction!</p>

<p>Ditte resigned herself to her lot. It cost her an
effort to remain under the same roof as her mother;
she would rather have left home. But this would have
reflected on her stepfather, and her sense of justice
rebelled against this. Then too the thought of her
little brothers and sisters kept her back; what would
become of them if she left?</p>

<p>She remained&mdash;and took up a definite position
towards her mother. Sörine was kind and considerate
to her, so much so that it was almost painful, but Ditte
pretended not to notice it. All advances from her
mother glanced off her. She was stubborn and determined,
carrying through what she set her mind on&mdash;the
mother was nothing to her.</p>

<p>Sörine's eyes constantly followed her when unobserved&mdash;she
was afraid of her. Had the child been in
the hut when it happened, or had she only arrived later?
Sörine was not sure whether she herself had overturned
the chair that evening in the darkness? How much did
Ditte know? That she knew something her mother
could tell from her face. She would have given much
to find out, and often touched upon the question&mdash;with
her uncertain glance at the girl.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis terrible to think that Granny should die
alone," she would say, hoping the child would give herself
away. But Ditte was obstinately silent.</p>

<p>One day Sörine gave Lars Peter a great surprise, by
putting a large sum of money on the table in front of
him. "Will that build the house, d'you think?" asked
she.</p>

<p>Lars Peter looked at her; he was astounded.</p>

<p>"I've saved it by selling eggs and butter and wool,"
said she; "and by starving you," she added with an
uncertain smile. "I know that I've been stingy and a
miser; but in the end it pays you as well."</p>

<p>It was so seldom she smiled. "How pretty it made
her!" thought Lars Peter, looking lovingly at her.
She had lately been happier and more even tempered&mdash;no
doubt the prospect of getting a better home.</p>

<p>He counted the money&mdash;over three hundred crowns!
"That's a step forward," said he. The next evening
when returning home he had bricks on the cart; and
every evening he continued bringing home materials
for building.</p>

<p>People who passed the Crow's Nest saw the erection
of beams and bricks shoot up, and rumors began to
float round the neighborhood. It began with a whisper
that the old woman had left more than had been
spoken of. Then it was said that perhaps, after all,
old Maren had not died a natural death. And some
remembered having seen Sörine on her way from the
Crow's Nest towards the hamlet, on the same afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
as her mother's death; little by little more was
added to this, until it was declared that Sörine had
strangled her own mother. Ditte was probably&mdash;with
the exception of the mother&mdash;the only one who knew
the real facts, and nothing could be got out of her
when it affected her family&mdash;least of all on an occasion
like this. But it was strange that she should happen
to arrive just at the critical moment; and still more
remarkable that she should run to Per Nielsen's and not
home with the news of her grandmother's death.</p>

<p>Neither Sörine herself nor Lars Peter heard a word
of these rumors. Ditte heard it at school through the
other children, but did not repeat it. When her mother
was more than usually considerate, her hate would seethe
up in her&mdash;"Devil!" it whispered inside her, and suddenly
she would feel an overwhelming desire to shout
to her father: "Mother stifled Granny with the eiderdown!"
It was worst of all when hearing her speak
lovingly about the old woman. But the thought of his
grief stopped her. He went about now like a great
child, seeing nothing, and was more than ever in love
with Sörine; he was overjoyed by the change for the
better. Ditte and the others loved him as never before.</p>

<p>When Sörine was too hard on the children, they
would hide from her outside the house, and only appear
when their father returned at night. But since Granny's
death there had been no need for this. The mother
was entirely changed; when her temper was about to
flare up, an unseen hand seemed to hold it back.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>But it happened at times that Ditte could not bear
to stay in the same room with her mother, and then she
would go back to her old way and hide herself.</p>

<p>One evening she lay crouching in the willows.
Sörine came time after time to the door, calling her in
a friendly voice, and at each call a feeling of disgust
went through the girl. "Ugh!" said she; it made her
almost sick. After having searched for her round the
house, Sörine went slowly up to the road and back
again, peering about all the time: passing so close to
Ditte that her dress brushed her face: then she went in.</p>

<p>Ditte was cold, and tired of hiding, but in she would
not go&mdash;not till her father came home. He might not
return until late, or not at all. Ditte had experienced
this before, but then there had been a reason for it.
It was no whipping she expected now!</p>

<p>No, but how lovely it had been to walk in holding her
father's hand. He asked no question now, but only
looked at the mother accusingly, and could not do
enough for one. Perhaps he would make an excuse for
a trip over to ... no ... this ... Ditte
began to cry. It was terrible that however much she
mourned for Granny&mdash;suddenly she would find she had
forgotten Granny was dead. "Granny's dead, dear
little Granny's dead," she would repeat to herself, so
that it should not happen again, but the next minute it
was just the same. It was so disloyal!</p>

<p>Now that it was too late, she was sorry she had not
gone in when her mother called. She drew her feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
up under her dress and began pulling up the grass to
keep herself awake. Hearing a sound from the distance
she jumped up&mdash;wheels approaching! but alas, it
was not the well-known rumbling of her father's
cart.</p>

<p>The cart turned from the road down in the direction
of the Crow's Nest. Two men got out and went into
the house; both wore caps with gold braid on. Ditte
crept down to the house, behind the willows; her heart
was beating loudly. The next moment they reappeared
with her mother between them; she was struggling and
shrieking wildly. "Lars Peter!" she cried heartrendingly
in the darkness; they had to use force to get
her into the cart. Inside the house the children could
be heard crying in fear.</p>

<p>This sound made Ditte forget everything else, and
she rushed forward. One of the men caught her by the
arm, but let her go at a sign from the other man.
"D'you belong to the house?" asked he.</p>

<p>Ditte nodded.</p>

<p>"Then go in to the little ones and tell them not to
be afraid.... Drive on!"</p>

<p>Quick as lightning, Sörine put both legs over the side
of the cart, but the policemen held her back. "Ditte,
help me!" she screamed, as the cart swung up the road
and disappeared.</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>Lars Peter was about three miles from the Crow's
Nest, turning into the road beside the grocer's, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
a cart drove past; in the light from the shop windows
he caught sight of gold-braided caps. "The police are
busy tonight!" said he, and shrugged his shoulders. He
proceeded up the road and began humming again,
mechanically flicking the nag with the whip as usual.
He sat bent forward, thinking of them all at home, of
what Sörine would have for him tonight&mdash;he was starving
with hunger&mdash;and of the children. It was a shame
that he was so late&mdash;it was pleasant when they all four
rushed to meet him. Perhaps, after all, they might not
be in bed.</p>

<p>The children stood out on the road, all four of them,
waiting for him; the little ones dared not stay in the
house. He stood as though turned to stone, holding on
to the cart for support, while Ditte with tears told what
had happened; it looked as if the big strong man would
collapse altogether. Then he pulled himself together
and went into the house with them, comforting them
all the time; the nag of its own accord followed with
the cart.</p>

<p>He helped Ditte put the children to bed. "Can you
look after the little ones tonight?" he asked, when they
had finished. "I must drive to town and fetch mother&mdash;it's
all a misunderstanding."</p>

<p>His voice sounded hollow.</p>

<p>Ditte nodded and followed him out to the cart.</p>

<p>He turned and set the horse in motion, but suddenly
he stopped.</p>

<p>"You know all about it, better than any one else,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Ditte," said he. "You can clear your mother." He
waited quietly, without looking at her, and listened.
There was no answer.</p>

<p>Then he turned the cart slowly round and began to
unharness.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_I" id="II_CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
Morning At The Crow's Nest</span></h2>


<p>Klavs was munching busily in his stall, with a
great deal of noise. He had his own peculiar way
of feeding; always separating the corn from the straw,
however well Lars Peter had mixed it. He would first
half empty the manger&mdash;so as to lay a foundation.
Then, having still plenty of room for further operations,
he would push the whole together in the middle
of the manger, blowing vigorously, so that the straw
flew in all directions, and proceed to nuzzle all the
corn. This once devoured, he would scrape his hoofs
on the stone floor and whinny.</p>

<p>Ditte laughed. "He's asking for more sugar," said
she. "Just like little Povl when he's eating porridge;
he scrapes the top off too."</p>

<p>But Lars Peter growled. "Eat it all up, you old
skeleton," said he. "These aren't times to pick and
choose."</p>

<p>The nag would answer with a long affectionate
whinny, and go on as before.</p>

<p>At last Lars Peter would get up and go to the
manger, mixing the straw together in the middle. "Eat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
it up, you obstinate old thing!" said he, giving the
horse a slap on the back. The horse, smelling the
straw, turned its head towards Lars Peter; and looked
reproachfully at him as though saying: "What's the
matter with you today?" And nothing else would
serve, but he must take a handful of corn and mix it
with the straw. "But no tricks now," said he, letting
his big hand rest on the creature's back. And this time
everything was eaten up.</p>

<p>Lars Peter came back and sat under the lantern
again.</p>

<p>"Old Klavs is wise," said Ditte, "he knows exactly
how far to go. But he's very faddy all the same."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, he knows that we're going on a long
trip; and wants a big feed beforehand," answered Lars
Peter as if in excuse. "Ay, he's a wise rascal!"</p>

<p>"But pussy's much sharper than that," said Ditte
proudly, "for she can open the pantry door herself.
I couldn't understand how she got in and drank the
milk; I thought little Povl had left the door open, and
was just going to smack him for it. But yesterday I
came behind pussy, and can you imagine what she
did? Jumped up on the sink, and flew against the
pantry door, striking the latch with one paw so it
came undone. Then she could just stand on the floor
and push the door open."</p>

<p>They sat under the lantern, which hung from one
of the beams, sorting rags, which lay round them in
bundles; wool, linen and cotton&mdash;all carefully separated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Outside it was cold and dark, but here it was
cosy. The old nag was working at his food like a
threshing machine, the cow lay panting with well-being
as it chewed the cud, and the hens were cackling
sleepily from the hen-house. The new pig was probably
dreaming of its mother&mdash;now and again a sucking
could be heard. It had only left its mother a few days
ago.</p>

<p>"Is this wool?" asked Ditte, holding out a big rag.</p>

<p>Lars Peter examined it, drew out a thread and put
it in the flame of the lantern.</p>

<p>"It should be wool," said he at last, "for it melts
and smells of horn. But Heaven knows," he felt the
piece of cloth again meditatively. "Maybe 'tis some
of those new-fashioned swindles; 'tis said they can make
plant stuff, so folks can't see the difference between it
and wool. And they make silk of glass too, I'm
told."</p>

<p>Ditte jumped up and opened the shutter, listening,
then disappeared across the yard. She returned shortly
afterwards.</p>

<p>"Was anything wrong with the children?" asked
Lars Peter.</p>

<p>"'Twas only little Povl crying; but how can they
make silk of glass?" asked she suddenly, "glass is so
brittle!"</p>

<p>"Ay, 'tis the new-fashioned silk though, and may be
true enough. If you see a scrap of silk amongst the
rags 'tis nearly always broken."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what queer thing's glass made of?"</p>

<p>"Ay, you may well ask that&mdash;if I could only tell you.
It can't be any relation to ice, as it doesn't melt even
when the sun shines on it. Maybe&mdash;no, I daren't try
explaining it to you. 'Tis a pity not to have learned
things properly; and think things out oneself."</p>

<p>"Can any folks do that?"</p>

<p>"Ay, there <i>must</i> be some, or how would everything
begin&mdash;if no one hit on them. I used to think and
ask about everything; but I've given it up now, I never
got to the bottom of it. This with your mother doesn't
make a fellow care much for life either." Lars Peter
sighed.</p>

<p>Ditte bent over her work. When this topic came up,
it was better to be silent.</p>

<p>For a few minutes neither spoke. Lars Peter's hands
were working slowly, and at last stopped altogether.
He sat staring straight ahead without perceiving anything;
he was often like this of late. He rose abruptly,
and went towards the shutter facing east, and opened
it; it was still night, but the stars were beginning to pale.
The nag was calling from the stall, quietly, almost unnoticeably.
Lars Peter fastened the shutter, and stumbled
out to the horse. Ditte followed him with her
eyes.</p>

<p>"What d'you want now?" he asked in a dull voice,
stroking the horse. The nag pushed its soft nose into
his shoulder. It was the gentlest caress Lars Peter
knew, and he gave it another supply of corn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Ditte turned her head towards them&mdash;she felt
anxious over her father's present condition. It was no
good going about hanging one's head.</p>

<p>"Is it going to have another feed?" said she, trying
to rouse him. "That animal'll eat us out of house and
home!"</p>

<p>"Ay, but it's got something to do&mdash;and we've a long
journey in front of us." Lars Peter came back and
began sorting again.</p>

<p>"How many miles is it to Copenhagen then?"</p>

<p>"Six or seven hours' drive, I should say; we've got
a load."</p>

<p>"Ugh, what a long way." Ditte shivered. "And
it's so cold."</p>

<p>"Ay, if I'm to go alone. But you might go with
me! 'Tisn't a pleasant errand, and the time'll go slowly
all that long way. And one can't get away from sad
thoughts!"</p>

<p>"I can't leave home," answered Ditte shortly.</p>

<p>For about the twentieth time Lars Peter tried to
talk her over. "We can easily get Johansens to keep
an eye on everything&mdash;and can send the children over
to them for a few days," said he.</p>

<p>But Ditte was not to be shaken. Her mother was
nothing to her, people could say what they liked; she
<i>would</i> not go and see her in prison. And her father
ought to stop talking like that or she would be angry;
it reminded her of Granny. She hated her mother
with all her heart, in a manner strange for her years.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
She never mentioned her, and when the others spoke
of her, she would be dumb. Good and self-sacrificing
as she was in all other respects, on this point she was
hard as a stone.</p>

<p>To Lars Peter's good-natured mind this hatred was
a mystery. However much he tried to reconcile her, in
the end he had to give up.</p>

<p>"Look and see if there's anything you want for
the house," said he.</p>

<p>"I want a packet of salt, the stuff they have at the
grocer's is too coarse to put on the table. And I must
have a little spice. I'm going to try making a cake myself,
bought cakes get dry so quickly."</p>

<p>"D'you think you can?" said Lars Peter admiringly.</p>

<p>"There's more to be got," Ditte continued undisturbed,
"but I'd better write it down; or you'll forget
half the things like you did last time."</p>

<p>"Ay, that's best," answered Lars Peter meekly.
"My memory's not as good as it used to be. I don't
know&mdash;I used to do hundreds of errands without forgetting
one. Maybe 'tis with your mother. And then
belike&mdash;a man gets old. Grandfather, he could remember
like a printed book, to the very last."</p>

<p>Ditte got up quickly and shook out her frock.</p>

<p>"There!" said she with a yawn. They put the rags
in sacks and tied them up.</p>

<p>"This'll fetch a little money," said Lars Peter dragging
the sacks to the door, where heaps of old iron and
other metals lay in readiness to be taken to the town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
"And what's the time now?&mdash;past six. Ought to be
daylight soon."</p>

<p>As Ditte opened the door the frosty air poured in.
In the east, over the lake, the skies were green, with
a touch of gold&mdash;it was daybreak. In the openings in
the ice the birds began to show signs of life. It was
as if the noise from the Crow's Nest had ushered in
the day for them, group after group began screaming
and flew towards the sea.</p>

<p>"It'll be a fine day," said Lars Peter as he dragged
out the cart. "There ought to be a thaw soon." He
began loading the cart, while Ditte went in to light the
fire for the coffee.</p>

<p>As Lars Peter came in, the flames from the open
fireplace were flickering towards the ceiling, the room
was full of a delicious fragrance, coffee and something
or other being fried. Kristian was kneeling in front
of the fire, feeding it with heather and dried sticks,
and Ditte stood over a spluttering frying-pan, stirring
with all her might. The two little ones sat on the end
of the bench watching the operations with glee, the
reflection of the fire gleaming in their eyes. The daylight
peeped in hesitatingly through the frozen window-panes.</p>

<p>"Come along, father!" said Ditte, putting the
frying-pan on the table on three little wooden supports.
"'Tis only fried potatoes, with a few slices of bacon,
but you're to eat it all yourself!"</p>

<p>Lars Peter laughed and sat down at the table. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
soon, however, as was his wont, began giving some to
the little ones; they got every alternate mouthful.
They stood with their faces over the edge of the table,
and wide open mouths&mdash;like two little birds. Kristian
had his own fork, and stood between his father's knees
and helped himself. Ditte stood against the table looking
on, with a big kitchen knife in her hand.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to have anything?" asked Lars
Peter, pushing the frying-pan further on to the table.</p>

<p>"There's not a scrap more than you can eat yourself;
we'll have something afterwards," answered Ditte,
half annoyed. But Lars Peter calmly went on feeding
them. He did not enjoy his food when there were no
open mouths round him.</p>

<p>"'Tis worth while waking up for this, isn't it?"
said he, laughing loudly; his voice was deep and
warm again.</p>

<p>As he drank his coffee, Söster and Povl hurried into
their clothes; they wanted to see him off. They ran
in between his and the nag's legs as he was harnessing.</p>

<p>The sun was just rising. There was a red glitter
over the ice-covered lake and the frosted landscape, the
reeds crackled as if icicles were being crushed. From
the horse's nostrils came puffs of air, showing white
in the morning light, and the children's quick short
breaths were like gusts of steam. They jumped round
the cart in their cloth shoes like two frolicsome young
puppies. "Love to Mother!" they shouted over and
over again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Lars Peter bent down from the top of the load,
where he was half buried between the sacks. "Shan't
I give her your love too?" asked he. Ditte turned
away her head.</p>

<p>Then he took his whip and cracked it. And slowly
Klavs set off on his journey.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_II" id="II_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
The Highroad</span></h2>


<p>"He's even more fond of the highroad than a
human being," Lars Peter used to say of
Klavs, and this was true; the horse was always
in a good temper whenever preparations were
being made for a long journey. For the short trips
Klavs did not care at all; it was the real highroad trips
with calls to right and left, and stopping at night in
some stable, which appealed to him. What he found to
enjoy in it would be difficult to say; hardly for the sake
of a new experience&mdash;as with a man. Though God
knows&mdash;'twas a wise enough rascal! At all events Klavs
liked to feel himself on the highroad, and the longer the
trip the happier he would be. He took it all with the
same good temper&mdash;up hills where he had to strain
in the shafts, and downhill where the full weight of
the cart made itself felt. He would only stop when
the hill was unusually steep&mdash;to give Lars Peter an
opportunity of stretching his legs.</p>

<p>To Lars Peter the highroad was life itself. It gave
daily bread to him and his, and satisfied his love of
roaming. Such a piece of highroad between rows of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
trimmed poplars with endless by-ways off to farms and
houses was full of possibilities. One could take this
turning or that, according to one's mood at the moment,
or leave the choice of the road to the nag. It always
brought forth something.</p>

<p>And the highroad was only the outward sign of an
endless chain. If one liked to wander straight on,
instead of turning off, ay, then one would get far out
in the world&mdash;as far as one cared. He did not do it
of course; but the thought that it could be done was
something in itself.</p>

<p>On the highroad he met people of his own blood:
tramps who crawled up without permission on to his
load, drawing a bottle from their pocket, offering it to
him, and talking away. They were people who traveled
far; yesterday they had come from Helsingör; in a
week's time they would perhaps be over the borders in
the south and down in Germany. They wore heavily
nailed boots, and had a hollow instead of a stomach, a
handkerchief round their throat and mittens on their
red wrists&mdash;and were full of good humor. Klavs
knew them quite well, and stopped of his own accord.</p>

<p>Klavs also stopped for poor women and school-children;
Lars Peter and he agreed that all who cared
to drive should have that pleasure. But respectable
people they passed by; they of course would not condescend
to drive with the rag and bone man.</p>

<p>They both knew the highroad with its by-ways
equally well. When anything was doing, such as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
thrashing-machine in the field, or a new house being
built, one or other of them always stopped. Lars
Peter pretended that it was the horse's inquisitiveness.
"Well, have you seen enough?" he growled when
they had stood for a short while, and gathered up the
reins. Klavs did not mind the deception in the least,
and in no way let it interfere with his own inclinations;
Klavs liked his own way.</p>

<p>Things must be black indeed, if the highroad did not
put the rag and bone man into a good temper. The
calm rhythmic trot of the nag's hoofs against the firm
road encouraged him to hum. The trees, the milestones
with the crown above King Christian the Fifth's
initials, the endless perspective ahead of him, with
all its life and traffic&mdash;all had a cheering effect on
him.</p>

<p>The snow had been trodden down, and only a thin
layer covered with ice remained, which rang under the
horse's big hoofs. The thin light air made breathing
easy, and the sun shone redly over the snow. It was
impossible to be anything but light-hearted. But then
he remembered the object of the drive, and all was dark
again.</p>

<p>Lars Peter had never done much thinking on his own
account, or criticized existence. When something or
other happened, it was because it could not be otherwise&mdash;and
what was the good of speculating about it?
When he was on the cart all these hours, he only
hummed a kind of melody and had a sense of well-being.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
"I wonder what mother'll have for supper?"
he would think, or "maybe the kiddies'll come to meet
me today." That was all. He took bad and good
trade as it came, and joy and sorrow just the same; he
knew from experience that rain and sunshine come by
turns. It had been thus in his parents' and grandparents'
time, and his own had confirmed it. Then why
speculate? If the bad weather lasted longer than
usual, well, the good was so much better when it
came.</p>

<p>And complaints were no good. Other people beside
himself had to take things as they came. He had never
had any strong feeling that there was a guiding hand
behind it all.</p>

<p>But now he <i>had</i> to think, however useless he found it.
Suddenly something would take him mercilessly by the
neck, and always face him with the same hopeless:
<i>Why</i>? A thousand times the thought of Sörine would
crop up, making everything heavy and sad.</p>

<p>Lars Peter had been thoroughly out of luck before&mdash;and
borne it as being part of his life's burden. He
had a thick skull and a broad back&mdash;what good were
they but for burdens; it was not his business to whimper
or play the weakling. And fate had heaped troubles
upon him: if he could bear that, then he can bear this!&mdash;till
at last he would break down altogether under the
burden. But his old stolidness was gone.</p>

<p>He had begun to think of his lot&mdash;and could fathom
nothing: it was all so meaningless, now he compared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
himself with others. As soon as ever he got into the
cart, and the nag into its old trot, these sad thoughts
would reappear, and his mind would go round and
round the subject until he was worn out. He could not
unravel it. Why was he called the rag and bone man,
and treated as if he were unclean? He earned his
living as honestly as any one else. Why should his
children be jeered at like outcasts&mdash;and his home called
the Crow's Nest? And why did the bad luck follow
him?&mdash;and fate? There was a great deal now that he
did not understand, but which must be cleared up. Misfortune,
which had so often knocked at his door without
finding him at home, had now at last got its foot
well inside the door.</p>

<p>However much Lars Peter puzzled over Sörine, he
could find no way out of it. It was his nature to look on
the bright side of things; and should it be otherwise
they were no sooner over than forgotten. He had only
seen her good points. She had been a clever wife,
good at keeping the home together&mdash;and a hard
worker. And she had given him fine children, that
alone made up for everything. He had been fond of
her, and proud of her firmness and ambition to get
on in the world. And now as a reward for her pride
she was in prison! For a long time he had clung to the
hope that it must be a mistake. "Maybe they'll let
her out one day," he thought. "Then she'll be standing
in the doorway when you return, and it's all been
a misunderstanding." It was some time now since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
sentence had been pronounced, so it must be right. But
it was equally difficult to understand!</p>

<p>There lay a horseshoe on the road. The nag
stopped, according to custom, and turned its head.
Lars Peter roused himself from his thoughts and peered
in front of the horse, then drove on again. Klavs could
not understand it, but left it at that: Lars Peter could
no longer be bothered to get off the cart to pick up an
old horseshoe.</p>

<p>He began whistling and looked out over the landscape
to keep his thoughts at bay. Down in the marsh
they were cutting ice for the dairies&mdash;it was high time
too! And the farmer from Gadby was driving off in his
best sledge, with his wife by his side. Others could
enjoy themselves! If only he had his wife in the cart&mdash;driving
in to the Capital. There now&mdash;he was beginning
all over again! Lars Peter looked in the opposite
direction, but what good was that. He could not get
rid of his thoughts.</p>

<p>A woman came rushing up the highroad, from a
little farm. "Lars Peter!" she cried. "Lars Peter!"
The nag stopped.</p>

<p>"Are you going to town?" she asked breathlessly,
leaning on the cart.</p>

<p>"Ay, that I am," Lars Peter answered quietly, as if
afraid of her guessing his errand.</p>

<p>"Oh! would you mind buying us a chamber?"</p>

<p>"What! you're getting very grand!" Lars Peter's
mouth twisted in some semblance of a smile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, the child's got rheumatic fever, and the doctor
won't let her go outside," the woman explained excusingly.</p>

<p>"I'll do that for you. How big d'you want it?"</p>

<p>"Well, as we must have it, it might as well be a big
one. Here's sixpence, it can't be more than that." She
gave him the money wrapped in a piece of paper, and
the nag set off again.</p>

<p>When they had got halfway, Lars Peter turned off
to an inn. The horse needed food, and something enlivening
for himself would not come amiss. He felt
downhearted. He drove into the yard, partly unharnessed,
and put on its nosebag.</p>

<p>The fat inn-keeper came to the door, peering out
with his small pig's eyes, which were deeply embedded
in a huge expanse of flesh, like two raisins in rising
dough. "Why, here comes the rag and bone man
from Sand!" he shouted, shaking with laughter.
"What brings such fine company today, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>Lars Peter had heard this greeting before, and
laughed at it, but today it affected him differently. He
had come to the end of his patience. His blood began
to rise. The long-suffering, thoughtful, slothful Lars
Peter turned his head with a jerk&mdash;showing a gleam of
teeth. But he checked himself, took off his cape, and
spread it over the horse.</p>

<p>"'Tis he for sure," began the inn-keeper again.
"His lordship of the Crow's Nest, doing us the honor."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>But this time Lars Peter blazed out.</p>

<p>"Hold your mouth, you beer-swilling pig!" he thundered,
stepping towards him with his heavy boots,
"or I'll soon close it for you!"</p>

<p>The inn-keeper's open mouth closed with a snap.
His small pig's eyes, which almost disappeared when
he laughed, opened widely in terror. He turned round
and rushed in. When Lars Peter, with a frown on his
face, came tramping into the tap-room, he was bustling
about, whistling softly with his fat tongue between his
teeth and looking rather small.</p>

<p>"A dram and a beer," growled the rag and bone
man, seating himself by the table and beginning to
unpack his food.</p>

<p>The inn-keeper came towards him with a bottle and
two glasses. He glanced uncertainly at Lars Peter,
and poured out two brimming glassfuls. "Your health,
old friend," said he ingratiatingly. The rag and bone
man drank without answering his challenge; he had
given the fat lump a fright, and now he was making up
to him. It was odd to be able to make people shiver&mdash;quite
a new feeling. But he rather liked it. And it
did him good to give vent to his anger; he had a feeling
of well-being after having let off steam. Here sat this
insolent landlord trying to curry favor, just because
one would not put up with everything. Lars Peter
felt a sudden inclination to put his foot upon his neck,
and give him a thorough shock. Or bend him over so
that head and heels met. Why should he not use his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
superior strength once in a while? Then perhaps
people would treat him with something like respect.</p>

<p>The inn-keeper sank down on a chair in front of him.
"Well, Lars Peter Hansen, so you've become a socialist?"
he began, blinking his eyes.</p>

<p>Lars Peter dropped his heavy fist on the table so
that everything jumped&mdash;the inn-keeper included.
"I'm done with being treated like dirt&mdash;do you understand!
I'm just as good as you and all the rest of them.
And if I hear any more nonsense, then to hell with
you all."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course! 'twas only fun, Lars Peter
Hansen. And how's every one at home? Wife and
children well?" He still blinked whenever Lars Peter
moved.</p>

<p>Lars Peter did not answer him, but helped himself to
another dram. The rascal knew quite well all about
Sörine.</p>

<p>"D'you know&mdash;you should have brought the wife
with you. <a class="corr" name="TC_4" id="TC_4" title="Women-folk">Womenfolk</a> love a trip to town," the inn-keeper
tried again. Lars Peter looked suspiciously at
him.</p>

<p>"What d'you mean by this tomfoolery?" he said
darkly. "You know quite well that she's in there."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;is she? Has she run away from you
then?"</p>

<p>Lars Peter took another glass. "She's locked up,
and you know it&mdash;curse you!" He put the glass down
heavily on the table.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>The landlord saw it was no good pretending ignorance.
"I think I do remember hearing something
about it," said he. "How was it&mdash;got into trouble
with the law somehow?"</p>

<p>The rag and bone man gave a hollow laugh. "I
should think so! She killed her own mother, 'tis said."
The spirit was beginning to affect him.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear! was it so bad as that?" sighed the
inn-keeper, turning and twisting as if he had a pain
inside. "And now you're going to the King, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Lars Peter lifted his head. "To the King?" he
asked. The thought struck him, perhaps this was the
miracle he had been hoping for.</p>

<p>"Ay, the King decides whether it's to be life or
death, you know. If there's any one he can't stand
looking at, he only says: 'Take that fellow and chop
off his head!' And he can let folk loose again too, if
he likes."</p>

<p>"And how's the likes of me to get near the King?"
The rag and bone man laughed hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easily done," said the inn-keeper airily.
"Every one in the country has the right to see the King.
When you get in there, just ask where he lives, any one
can tell you."</p>

<p>"Hm, I know that myself," said Lars Peter with
assurance. "I was once nearly taken for the guards
myself&mdash;for the palace. If it hadn't been for having
flat feet, then&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it isn't quite as easy as you think; he's got
so many mansions. The King's got no-one to associate
with, you see, as there's only one King in every land,
and talk to his wife always, no man could stand&mdash;the
King as little as we others. That's why he gets bored,
and moves from one castle to another, and plays at
making a visitor of himself. So you'd better make
inquiries. 'Twouldn't come amiss to get some one to
speak for you either. You've got money, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I've got goods on the cart for over a hundred
crowns," said Lars Peter with pride.</p>

<p>"That's all right, because in the Capital nearly all
the doors need oiling before they are opened. Maybe
the castle gate will creak a little, but then&mdash;&mdash;" The
inn-keeper rubbed one palm against the other.</p>

<p>"Then we'll oil it," said Lars Peter, with a wave
of his arm as he got up.</p>

<p>He had plenty of courage now, and hummed as he
harnessed the horse and got into the cart. Now he
knew what to do, and he was anxious to act. Day and
night he had been faced with the question of getting
Sörine out of prison, but how? It was no good trying
to climb the prison wall at night, and fetch her out, as
one read of in books. But he could go to the King!
Had he not himself nearly been taken into the King's
service as a guardsman? "He's got the height and
the build," they had said. Then they had noticed his
flat feet and rejected him; but still he had said he
almost&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_III" id="II_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
Lars Peter Seeks The King</span></h2>


<p>Lars Peter Hansen knew nothing of the Capital.
As a boy he had been there with his father,
but since then no opportunity had arisen for a trip to
Copenhagen. He and Sörine had frequently spoken of
taking their goods there and selling direct to the big
firms, instead of going the round of the small provincial
dealers, but nothing had ever come of it beyond talk.
But today the thing was to be done. He had seen
posters everywhere advertising: "The largest house
in Scandinavia for rags and bones and old metals,"
and "highest prices given." It was the last statement
which had attracted him.</p>

<p>Lars Peter sat reckoning up, as he drove along the
Lyngby road towards the eastern end of the city. Going
by prices at home he had a good hundred crowns'
worth of goods on the cart; and here it ought to fetch
at least twenty-five crowns more. That would perhaps
pay for Sörine's release. This was killing two birds
with one stone, getting Sörine out&mdash;and making money
on the top of it! All that was necessary was to keep
wide awake. He lifted his big battered hat and ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
his hand through his tousled mop of hair&mdash;he was in
a happy mood.</p>

<p>At Trianglen he stopped and inquired his way. Then
driving through Blegdamsvej he turned into a side
street. Over a high wooden paling could be seen mountains
of old rusty iron: springs and empty tins, bent
iron beds, dented coal-boxes red with rust, and pails.
This must be the place. On the signboard stood:
<i>Levinsohn &amp; Sons, Export</i>.</p>

<p>The rag and bone man turned in through the gateway
and stopped bewildered as he came into the yard. Before
him were endless erections of storing-places and
sheds, one behind the other, and inclosures with masses
of rags, dirty cotton-wool and rusty iron and tin-ware.
From every side other yards opened out, and beyond
these more again. If he and Klavs went gathering rags
until Doomsday, they would never be able to fill one
yard. He sat and gazed, overwhelmed. Involuntarily
he had taken his hat off, but then, gathering himself
together, he drove into one of the sheds and jumped
down from the cart. Hearing voices, he opened the
door. In the darkness sat some young girls sorting
some filth or other, which looked like blood-stained
rags.</p>

<p>"Well, well, what a dove-cote to land in," broke out
Lars Peter in high spirits. "What's that you're doing,
sorting angels' feathers?" The room was filled with
his good-humored chuckles.</p>

<p>As quick as lightning one of the girls grasped a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
bundle and threw it at him. He only just escaped it
by bending his head, and the thing brought up against
the door-post. It was cotton-wool covered with blood
and matter&mdash;from the hospital dust-bins. He knew
that there was a trade in this in the Capital. "Puh!"
he said in disgust, and hurried out. "Filthy, pish!"
A shout of laughter went up from the girls.</p>

<p>From the head-office a little spectacled gentleman
came tripping towards him. "What&mdash;what are you
doing here?" he barked from afar, almost falling over
himself in his eagerness. "It&mdash;it's no business of yours
prying in here!" He was dreadfully dirty and unshaven,
his collar and frock-coat looked as if they had
been fished up from a ragbag. No, the trade never
made Lars Peter as dirty as that; why, the dirt was in
layers on this old man. But of course&mdash;this business
was ever so much bigger than his own! Good-naturedly,
he took off his hat.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Levinsohn?" asked he, when the old
man had finished. "I've got some goods."</p>

<p>The old man stared at him speechless with surprise
that any one could be so impudent as to take him for
the head of the firm. "Oh, you're looking for Mr.
Levinsohn," he said searchingly, "indeed?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I've got some goods I want to sell."</p>

<p>Now the old man understood. "And you must see
him, himself&mdash;it's a matter of life and death&mdash;eh? No
one else in the whole world can buy those goods from
you, or the shaft'll break and the rags'll fall out and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
break to pieces, and Heaven knows what! So you must
see Mr. Levinsohn himself." He looked the rag
and bone man up and down, almost bursting with
scorn.</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't mind seeing him himself," Lars
Peter patiently said.</p>

<p>"Then you'd better drive down to the Riviera with
your dust-cart, my good man."</p>

<p>"What, where?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to the Riviera!" The old man rubbed his
hands. He was enjoying himself immensely. "It's
only about fourteen hundred miles from here&mdash;over
there towards the south. The best place to find him is
Monte Carlo&mdash;between five and seven. And his wife
and daughters&mdash;I suppose you want to see them too?
Perhaps a little flirtation? A little walk&mdash;underneath
the palm-trees, what?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord! is he a grand sort like that," said
Lars Peter, crestfallen. "Well&mdash;maybe I can trade
with you?"</p>

<p>"At your service, Mr. Jens Petersen from&mdash;Sengelöse;
if you, sir, will condescend to deal with a
poor devil like me."</p>

<p>"I may just as well tell you that my name is Lars
Peter Hansen&mdash;from Sand."</p>

<p>"Indeed&mdash;the firm feels honored, highly honored, I
assure you!" The old man bustled round the cartload,
taking in the value at a glance, and talking all the
time. Suddenly he seized the nag by the head, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
quickly let go, as Klavs snapped at him. "We'll drive
it down to the other yard," said he.</p>

<p>"I think we'd better leave the goods on the cart,
until we've agreed about the price," Lars Peter
thought; he was beginning to be somewhat suspicious.</p>

<p>"No, my man, we must have the whole thing emptied
out, so that we can see what we're buying," said the
old man in quite another tone. "That's not our
way."</p>

<p>"And I don't sell till I know my price. It's all
weighed and sorted, Lars Peter's no cheat."</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not. So it's really you? Lars
Peter Hansen&mdash;and from Sand too&mdash;and no cheat.
Come with me into the office then."</p>

<p>The rag and bone man followed him. He was a little
bewildered, was the man making a fool of him, or did
he really know him? Round about at home Lars Peter
of Sand was known by every one; had his name as a
buyer preceded him?</p>

<p>He had all the weights in his head, and gave the
figures, while the old man put them down. In the
midst of this he suddenly realized that the cart had
disappeared. He rushed out, and down in the other
yard found two men engaged in unloading the cart.
For the second time today Lars Peter lost his temper.
"See and get those things on to the cart again," he
shouted, picking up his whip. The two men hastily
took his measure; then without a word reloaded the
cart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>He was no longer in doubt that they would cheat him.
The cursed knaves! If they had emptied it all out
on to the heap, then he could have whistled for his own
price. He drove the cart right up to the office door,
and kept the reins on his arm. The old fox stood by his
desk, looking at him out of the corners of his eyes.
"Were they taking your beautiful horse from you?"
he asked innocently.</p>

<p>"No, 'twas something else they wanted to have their
fingers in," growled Lars Peter; he would show them
that he could be sarcastic too. "Now then, will you
buy the goods or not?"</p>

<p>"Of course we'll buy them. Look here, I've
reckoned it all up. It'll be exactly fifty-six crowns&mdash;highest
market price."</p>

<p>"Oh, go to the devil with your highest market
price!" Lars Peter began mounting the cart again.</p>

<p>The old man looked at him in surprise through his
spectacles: "Then you won't sell?"</p>

<p>"No, that I won't. I'd rather take it home again&mdash;and
get double the price."</p>

<p>"Well, if you say so of course&mdash;Lars Peter Hansen's
no cheat. But what are we to do, my man? My conscience
won't allow me to send you dragging those
things home again&mdash;it would be a crime to this beautiful
horse." He approached the nag as if to pat it,
but Klavs laid back his ears and lashed his tail. This
praise of his horse softened Lars Peter, and the end
of it was that he let the load go for ninety crowns. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
cigar was thrown into the bargain. "It's from the
cheap box, so please don't light it until you get outside
the gate," said the impudent old knave. "Come again
soon!"</p>

<p>Thanks! It would be some time before he came here
again&mdash;a pack of robbers! He asked the way to an inn
in Vestergade, where people from his neighborhood
generally stayed, and there he unharnessed.</p>

<p>The yard was full of vehicles. Farmers with pipes
hanging from their lips and fur-coats unbuttoned were
loading their wagons. Here and there between the
vehicles were loiterers, with broad gold chains across
their chest and half-closed eyes. One of them came
up to Lars Peter. "Are you doing anything tonight?"
said he. "There's a couple of us here&mdash;retired
farmers&mdash;going to have a jolly evening together. We
want a partner." He drew a pack of cards from his
breast-pocket, and began shuffling them.</p>

<p>No, Lars Peter had no time. "All the same,
thanks." "Who are those men?" he asked the stable-boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, they help the farmers to find their way about
town, when it's dark," answered the man, laughing.</p>

<p>"Are they paid for that then?" asked Lars Peter
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;and sometimes a good deal. But then
they fix up other things besides&mdash;lodging for the night
and everything. Even a wife they'll get for you, if
you like."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I don't care about that. If they'd only help
a man to get hold of his own wife!"</p>

<p>"I don't think they do that. But you can try."</p>

<p>No, Lars Peter would not do that. He realized
these were folk it was better to avoid. Then he sauntered
out into the town. At Hauserplads there was an
inn kept by a man he knew&mdash;he would look him up.
Maybe he could give him a little help in managing the
affair.</p>

<p>The street-lamps were just being lit, although it was
not nearly dark; evidently there was no lack of money
here. Lars Peter clattered in his big boots down
towards Frue Plads, examining the houses as he went.
This stooping giant, with faded hat and cape, looked
like a wandering piece of the countryside. When he
asked the way his voice rang through the street&mdash;although
it was not loud for him. People stopped and
laughed. Then he laughed back again and made some
joke or other, which, though he did not mean it,
sounded like a storm between the rows of houses.
Gradually a crowd of children and young people
gathered and followed in his wake. When they shouted
after him he took it with good humor, but was not
altogether at his ease until he reached the tavern. Here
he took out his red pocket handkerchief and wiped the
perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Hans Mattisen," he shouted down into
the dark cellar. "D'you know an old friend again,
what?" His joy over having got so far made his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
voice sound still more overpowering than usual; there
was hardly room for it under the low ceiling.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, not so fast!" came from a jolly voice
behind the counter, "wait until I get a light."</p>

<p>When the gas was lit, they found they did not know
each other at all. Hans Mattisen had left years ago.
"Don't you worry about that," said the inn-keeper,
"sit down." After Lars Peter had seated himself, he
was given some lobscouse and a small bottle of wine,
and soon felt at peace with the world.</p>

<p>The inn-keeper was a pleasant man with a keen sense
of humor. Lars Peter was glad of a talk with him,
and before he was aware of it, had poured out all his
troubles. Well, he had come down here to get advice;
and he had not gone far wrong either.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said the inn-keeper, "we'll soon put
that right. We've only to send a message to the Bandmaster."</p>

<p>"Who's that?" asked Lars Peter.</p>

<p>"Oh, he has the cleverest head in the world; there's
not a piece of music but he can manage it. Curious
fellow&mdash;never met one like him. For example, he can't
bear dogs, because once a police-dog took him for an
ordinary thief. He never can forget that. Therefore,
if he asks, you've only to say that dogs are a damned
nuisance&mdash;almost as loathsome as the police. He can't
stand them either. Hi! Katrine," he called into the
kitchen, "get hold of the Bandmaster quick, and tell
him to come along&mdash;give him plenty of drink too, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
he must be thawed before you get anything out of
him."</p>

<p>"No fear about that," said Lars Peter airily, putting
a ten-crown piece on the table, which the inn-keeper
quickly pocketed. "That's right, old man&mdash;that's doing
the thing properly," said he appreciatively. "I'll
see to the whiskey. You're a gentleman, that's
certain&mdash;you've got a well-filled pocketbook, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"I've got about a hundred crowns," answered Lars
Peter, fearing it would not suffice.</p>

<p>"You shall see your wife!" shouted the inn-keeper,
shaking Lars Peter's hand violently. "You shall see
your wife as certain as I'm your friend! Perhaps she'll
be with you tonight. What do you think of that, eh, old
man?" He put his arm round Lars Peter's shoulders,
shaking him jovially.</p>

<p>Lars Peter laughed and was moved&mdash;he almost had
tears in his eyes. He was a little overcome by the
warmth of the room and the whiskey.</p>

<p>A tall thin gentleman came down into the cellar.
He wore a black frock-coat, but was without waistcoat
and collar&mdash;perhaps because he had been sent for
in such a hurry. He had spectacles on, and looked on
the whole a man of authority. He had a distinguished
appearance, somewhat like a town-crier or a conjurer
from the market-place. His voice was shrill and
cracked, and he had an enormous larynx.</p>

<p>The inn-keeper treated him with great deference.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
"G'day, sir," said he, bowing low&mdash;"here's a man
wants advice. He's had an accident, his wife's having a
holiday at the King's expense."</p>

<p>The conductor glanced rather contemptuously at the
rag and bone man's big shabby figure. But the inn-keeper
winked one eye, and said, "I mustn't forget the
beer-man." He went behind the desk and wrote on a
slate, "100." The Bandmaster glanced at the figure
and nodded to himself, then sat down and began to
question Lars Peter&mdash;down to every detail. He considered
for a few minutes, and then said, turning
towards the <a class="corr" name="TC_5" id="TC_5" title="innkeeper">inn-keeper</a>, "Alma must tackle this&mdash;she's
playing with the <i>princess</i>, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course!" shouted the inn-keeper, delightedly.
"Of course Alma can put it right, but tonight&mdash;&mdash;?"
He looked significantly at the Bandmaster.</p>

<p>"Leave it to me, my dear friend. Just you leave it
to me," said the other firmly.</p>

<p>Lars Peter tried hard to follow their conversation.
They were funny fellows to listen to, although the case
itself was serious enough. He began to feel drowsy
with the heat of the room&mdash;after his long day in the
fresh air.</p>

<p>"Well, my good man, you wish to see the King?"
said the Bandmaster, taking hold of the lapel of his
coat. Lars Peter pulled himself together.</p>

<p>"I'd like to try that way, yes," he answered with
strained attention.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, then listen. I'll introduce you to my
niece, who plays with the princess. This is how it
stands, you see&mdash;but it's between ourselves&mdash;the
<i>princess</i> rather runs off the lines at times, she gets so
sick of things, but it's incognito, you understand&mdash;unknowingly,
we say&mdash;and then my niece is always by
her side. You'll meet her&mdash;and the rest you must do
yourself."</p>

<p>"H'm, I'm not exactly dressed for such fine society,"
said Lars Peter, looking down at himself. "And I'm
out of practice with the womenfolk&mdash;if it had been in
my young days, now&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," said his friend, "people
of high degree often have the most extraordinary taste.
It would be damned strange if the <i>princess</i> doesn't fall
in love with you. And if she once takes a fancy to you,
you may bet your last dollar that your case is in good
hands."</p>

<p>The inn-keeper diligently refilled their glasses, and
Lars Peter looked more and more brightly at things.
He was overcome by the Bandmaster's grand connections,
and his ability in finding ways and means&mdash;exceedingly
clever people he had struck upon. And when
Miss Alma came, full-figured and with a curled fringe,
his whole face beamed. "What a lovely girl," said
he warmly, "just the kind I'd have liked in the old
days."</p>

<p>Miss Alma at once wanted to sit on his knee, but Lars
Peter kept her at arms' length. "I've got a wife," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
he seriously. Sörine should have no grounds for complaint.
A look from the Bandmaster made Alma draw
herself up.</p>

<p>"Just wait until the <i>princess</i> comes, then you'll see
a lady," said he to Lars Peter.</p>

<p>"She's not coming. She's at a ball tonight," said
Miss Alma with resentment.</p>

<p>"Then we'll go to the palace and find her." The
Bandmaster took his hat, and they all got up.</p>

<p>Outside in the street, a half-grown girl ran up and
whispered something to him.</p>

<p>"Sorry, but I must go," said he to Lars Peter&mdash;"my
mother-in-law is at death's door. But you'll have
a good time all right."</p>

<p>"Come along," cried Miss Alma, taking the rag and
bone man by the arm. "We two are going to see
life!"</p>

<p>"Hundred&mdash;er&mdash;kisses, Alma! don't forget," called
the Bandmaster after them. His voice sounded like a
market crier's.</p>

<p>"All right," answered Miss Alma, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"What's that he says?" asked Lars Peter wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Don't you bother your head about that fool," she
answered, and drew him along.</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>Next morning Lars Peter woke early&mdash;as usual.
There was a curious illumination in the sky, and with
terror he tumbled quickly out of bed. Was the barn on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
fire? Then suddenly he remembered that he was not
at home; the gleam of light on the window-panes came
from the street lamps, which struggled with the dawn
of day.</p>

<p>He found himself in a dirty little room, at the top
of the house&mdash;as far as he could judge from the roofs
all round him. How in the name of goodness had he
got here?</p>

<p>He seated himself on the edge of the bed, and began
dressing. Slowly one thing after another began to
dawn on him. His head throbbed like a piston rod&mdash;headache!
He heard peculiar sounds: chattering
women, hoarse rough laughter, oaths&mdash;and from outside
came the peal of church bells. Through all the
noise and tobacco smoke came visions of a fair fringe,
and soft red lips&mdash;the <i>princess</i>! But how did he come
to be here, in an iron bed with a lumpy mattress, and
ragged quilt?</p>

<p>He felt for his watch to see the time&mdash;the old silver
watch had vanished! Anxiously he searched his inner
pocket&mdash;thank Heaven! the pocketbook was there alright.
But what had happened to his watch? Perhaps
it had fallen on the floor. He hurried into his clothes,
to look for it&mdash;the big leather purse felt light in his
pocket. It was empty! He opened his pocketbook&mdash;that
too was empty!</p>

<p>Lars Peter scrambled downstairs, dreading lest any
one should see him, slipped out into one of the side
streets, and stumbled to the inn, harnessed the nag and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
set off. He began to long for the children at home&mdash;yes,
and for the cows and pigs too.</p>

<p>Not until he was well outside the town, with a cold
wind blowing on his forehead, did he remember Sörine.
And, suddenly realizing the full extent of his disaster,
he broke down and sobbed helplessly.</p>

<p>He halted at the edge of the wood&mdash;just long enough
for Klavs to have a feed. He himself had no desire for
food then. He was on the highroad again, and sat
huddled up in the cart, while the previous evening's
debauch sang through his head.</p>

<p>At one place a woman came running towards him.
"Lars Peter!" she shouted, "Lars Peter!" The nag
stopped. Lars Peter came to himself with a jerk;
without a word he felt in his waistcoat pocket,
gave her back her coin, and whipped up the
horse.</p>

<p>On the highroad, some distance from home, a group
of children stood waiting. Ditte had not been able to
manage them any longer. They were cold and in tears.
Lars Peter took them up into the cart, and they gathered
round him, each anxious to tell him all the
news. He took no notice of their chatter. Ditte
sat quietly, looking at him out of the corners of her
eyes.</p>

<p>When he was seated at his meal, she said,
"Where're all the things you were to buy for me?"
He looked up startled, and began stammering something
or other&mdash;an excuse&mdash;but stopped in the middle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"How was mother getting on?" asked Ditte then.
She was sorry for him, and purposely used the word
"mother" to please him.</p>

<p>For a few moments his features worked curiously.
Then he buried his face in his hands.</p>




<hr class="chapbreak" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>
<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_IV" id="II_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
Little Mother Ditte</span></h2>


<p>At first, Lars Peter told them nothing of his visit
to the Capital. But Ditte was old enough to
read between the lines, and drew her own conclusions.
At all events, her commission had not been
executed. Sörine, for some reason or other, he had not
seen either, as far as she could understand; and no
money had been brought home. Apparently it had all
been squandered&mdash;spent in drink no doubt.</p>

<p>"Now he'll probably take to getting drunk, like
Johansen and the others in the huts," she thought with
resignation. "Come home and make a row because
there is nothing to eat&mdash;and beat us."</p>

<p>She was prepared for the worst, and watched him
closely. But Lars Peter came home steady as usual.
He returned even earlier than before. He longed for
children and home when he was away. And, as was his
custom, he gave an account of what he had made and
spent. He would clear out the contents of his trouser-pockets
with his big fist, spreading the money out over
the table, so that they could count it together and lay
their plans accordingly. But now he liked a glass with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
his meals! Sörine had never allowed him this, there
was no need for it&mdash;said she&mdash;it was a waste of money.
Ditte gave it willingly, and took care to have it ready
for him&mdash;after all, he was a man!</p>

<p>Lars Peter was really ashamed of his trip to town,
and not least of all that he had been made such a fool
of. The stupid part of it was that he remembered so
little of what had happened. Where had he spent the
night&mdash;and in what society? From a certain time in the
evening until he woke the following morning in that
filthy bedroom, all was like a vague dream&mdash;good or
bad, he knew not. But in spite of his shame he felt a
secret satisfaction in having for once kicked over the
traces. He had seen life. How long had he been
out? Jolting round from farm to farm, he would
brood on the question, would recall some parts of the
evening and suppress others&mdash;to get as much pleasure
out of it as possible. But in the end he was none the
wiser.</p>

<p>However, it was impossible for him to keep any
secret for long. First one thing, then another, came
out, and eventually Ditte had a pretty good idea of
what had happened, and would discuss it with him.
In the evenings, when the little ones were in bed, they
would talk it over.</p>

<p>"But don't you think she was a real princess?"
asked Ditte each time. She always came back to this&mdash;it
appealed to her vivid imagination and love of
adventure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Lord only knows," answered her father
thoughtfully. He could not fathom how he could have
been such a fool; he had managed so well with the Jews
in the stable-yard. "Ay, the Lord only knows!"</p>

<p>"And the Bandmaster," said Ditte eagerly, "he
must have been a wonderful man."</p>

<p>"Ay, that's true&mdash;a conjurer! He made I don't
know how many drinks disappear without any one seeing
how it was done. He held the glass on the table
in his left hand, slapped his elbow with his right&mdash;and
there it was empty."</p>

<p>To Ditte it was a most exciting adventure, and incidents
that had seemed far from pleasant to Lars Peter
became wonders in Ditte's version of the affair. Lars
Peter was grateful for the child's help, and together
they spoke of it so long, that slowly, and without his
being aware of it, the whole experience assumed quite
a different aspect.</p>

<p>It certainly had been a remarkable evening. And the
princess&mdash;yes, she must have been there in reality,
strange though it sounded that a beggar like him should
have been in such company. But the devil of a woman
she was to drink and smoke. "Ay, she was real enough&mdash;or
I wouldn't have been so taken with her," admitted
he.</p>

<p>"Then you've slept with a real princess&mdash;just like
the giant in the fairy tale," broke out Ditte, clapping her
hands in glee. "You have, father!" She looked
beamingly at him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>Lars Peter was silent with embarrassment, and sat
blinking at the lamp&mdash;he had not looked upon it in the
innocent light of a fairy tale. To him it seemed&mdash;well,
something rather bad&mdash;it was being unfaithful to
Sörine.</p>

<p>"Ay, that's true," said he. "But then, will Mother
forgive it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind!" answered Ditte. "But it was
a good thing you didn't cut yourself!"</p>

<p>Lars Peter lifted his head, looking uncertainly at her.</p>

<p>"Ay, because there must have been a drawn sword
between you&mdash;there always is. You see, princesses are
too grand to be touched."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ay! that's more than likely." Lars Peter
turned this over in his mind. The explanation pleased
him, and he took it to himself; it was a comforting idea.
"Ay, 'tis dangerous to have dealings with princesses,
even though a man doesn't know it at the time,"
said he.</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>Lars Peter thought no more of visiting Sörine in
prison. He would have liked to see her and clasp her
hand, even though it were only through an iron grating;
but it was not to be. He must have patience until she
had served her time.</p>

<p>To him the punishment was that they had to live
apart in the coming years. He lacked imagination to
comprehend Sörine's life behind prison walls, and
therefore he could not think of her for long at a time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
But unconsciously he missed her, so much so that he felt
depressed.</p>

<p>Lars Peter was no longer eager to work&mdash;the motive
power was lacking. He was too easily contented with
things as they were; there was no-one to taunt him with
being poorer than others. Ditte was too good-natured;
she was more given to taking burdens on her own
shoulders.</p>

<p>He had grown quieter, and stooped more than ever.
He played less with the children, and his voice had lost
some of its ring. He never sang now, as he drove up
to the farms to trade; he felt that people gossiped about
him and his affairs, and this took away his confidence.
It made itself felt when housewives and maids no longer
smiled and enjoyed his jokes or cleared out all their
old rubbish for him. He was never invited inside now&mdash;he
was the husband of a murderess! Trade
dwindled away&mdash;not that he minded&mdash;it gave him more
time with the children at home.</p>

<p>At the same time there was less to keep house on.
But, thanks to Ditte, they scraped along; little as she
was, she knew how to make both ends meet, so they
did not starve.</p>

<p>There was now plenty of time for Lars Peter to
build. Beams and stones lay all round as a silent reproach
to him.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to do anything with it?"
Ditte would ask. "Folk say it's lying there wasting."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where did you hear that?" asked Lars Peter
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;at school!"</p>

<p>So they talked about that too! There was not much
where he was concerned which was not torn to pieces.
No, he had no desire to build. "We've got a roof over
our heads," said he indifferently. "If any one thinks
our hut's not good enough, let them give us another."
But the building materials remained there as an accusation;
he was not sorry when they were overgrown with
grass.</p>

<p>What good would it do to build? The Crow's Nest
was, and would remain, the Crow's Nest, however
much they tried to polish it up. It had not grown in
esteem by Sörine's deed. She had done her best to give
them a lift up in the world&mdash;and had only succeeded in
pushing them down to the uttermost depth. Previously,
it had only been misfortune which clung to the house,
and kept better people away; now it was crime. No-one
would come near the house after dusk, and by day
they had as little as possible to do with the rag and
bone man. The children were shunned; they were the
offspring of a murderess, and nothing was too bad to be
thought of them.</p>

<p>The people tried to excuse their harshness, and justified
their behavior towards the family, by endowing
them with all the worst qualities. At one time it was
reported that they were thieves. But that died down,
and then they said that the house was haunted. Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Maren went about searching for her money; first one,
then another, had met her on the highroad at night,
on her way to the Crow's Nest.</p>

<p>The full burden of all this fell on the little ones. It
was mercilessly thrown in their faces by the other children
at school; and when they came home crying, Lars
Peter of course had to bear his share too. No-one
dared say anything to him, himself&mdash;let them try if
they dared! The rag and bone man's fingers tingled
when he heard all this backbiting&mdash;why couldn't he and
his be allowed to go in peace. He wouldn't mind catching
one of the rogues red-handed. He would knock him
down in cold blood, whatever the consequences might
be.</p>

<p>Kristian now went to school too, in the infants' class.
The classes were held every other day, and his did not
coincide with Ditte's, who was in a higher class. He
had great difficulty in keeping up with the other children,
and could hardly be driven off in the mornings.
"They call me the young crow," he said,
crying.</p>

<p>"Then call them names back again," said Ditte;
and off he had to go.</p>

<p>But one day there came a message from the schoolmaster
that the boy was absent too often. The message
was repeated. Ditte could not understand it. She had
a long talk with the boy, and got out of him that he
often played truant. He made a pretense of going to
school, hung about anywhere all day long, and only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
returned home when school-time was over. She said
nothing of this to Lars Peter&mdash;it would only have made
things worse.</p>

<p>The unkindness from outside made them cling more
closely to one another. There was something of the
hunted animal in them; Lars Peter was reserved in
his manner to people, and was ready to fly out if attacked.
The whole family grew shy and suspicious.
When the children played outside the house, and saw
people approaching on the highroad, they would rush
in, peeping at them from behind the broken window-panes.
Ditte watched like a she-wolf, lest other children
should harm her little brothers and sister; when
necessary, she would both bite and kick, and she could
hurl words at them too. One day when Lars Peter was
driving past the school, the schoolmaster came out
and complained of her&mdash;she used such bad language.
He could not understand it; at home she was always
good and saw that the little ones behaved properly.
When he spoke of this, Ditte hardened.</p>

<p>"I won't stand their teasing," said she.</p>

<p>"Then stay at home from school, and then we'll
see what they'll do."</p>

<p>"We'll only be fined for every day; and then one
day they'll come and fetch me," said Ditte bitterly.</p>

<p>"They won't easily take you away by force. Somebody
else would have something to say to that." Lars
Peter nodded threateningly.</p>

<p>But Ditte would not&mdash;she would take her chance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
"I've just as much right to be there as the others," she
said stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, that's so. But it's a shame you should
suffer for other people's wickedness."</p>

<p>Lars Peter seldom went out now, but busied himself
cultivating his land, so that he could be near the children
and home. He had a feeling of insecurity; people had
banded themselves together against him and his family,
and meant them no good. He was uneasy when away
from home, and constantly felt as if something had
happened. The children were delighted at the change.</p>

<p>"Are you going to stay at home tomorrow too,
Father?" asked the two little ones every evening, gazing
up at him with their small arms round his huge legs.
Lars Peter nodded.</p>

<p>"We must keep together here in the Crow's Nest,"
said he to Ditte as if in excuse. "We can't get rid of
the 'rag and bone man'&mdash;or the other either; but no-one
can prevent us from being happy together."</p>

<p>Well, Ditte did not object to his staying at home.
As long as they got food, the rest was of no consequence.</p>

<p>Yes, they certainly must keep together&mdash;and get all
they could out of one another, otherwise life would
be too miserable to bear. On Sundays Lars Peter
would harness the nag and drive them out to Frederiksvaerk,
or to the other side of the lake. It was pleasant
to drive, and as long as they possessed a horse and
cart, they could not be utterly destitute.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Their small circle of acquaintances had vanished, but
thanks to Klavs they found new friends. They were a
cottager's family by the marsh&mdash;people whom no-one
else would have anything to do with. There were
about a dozen children, and though both the man and
his wife went out as day laborers, they could not keep
them, and the parish had to help. Lars Peter had frequently
given them a hand with his cart, but there had
never been much intercourse as long as Sörine was in
command of the Crow's Nest. But now it came quite
naturally. Birds of a feather flock together&mdash;so people
said.</p>

<p>To the children it meant play-fellows and comrades
in disgrace. It was quite a treat to be asked over to
Johansens on a Sunday afternoon, or even more so to
have them at the Crow's Nest. There was a certain
satisfaction in having visitors under their roof, and
giving them the best the house could provide. For days
before they came Ditte would be busy making preparations:
setting out milk for cream to have with the coffee,
and buying in all they could afford. On Sunday morning
she would cut large plates of bread-and-butter, to
make it easier for her in the afternoon. As soon as the
guests arrived, they would have coffee, bread-and-butter
and home-made cakes. Then the children would play
"Touch," or "Bobbies and Thieves." Lars Peter
allowed them to run all over the place, and there would
be wild hunting in and outside the Crow's Nest. In the
meanwhile the grown-ups wandered about in the fields,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
looking at the crops. Ditte went with them, keeping
by the side of Johansen's wife, with her hands under
her apron, just as she did.</p>

<p>At six o'clock they had supper, sandwiches with beer
and brandy; then they would sit for a short time talking,
before going home. There was the evening work
to be done, and every one had to get up early the next
morning.</p>

<p>They were people even poorer than themselves.
They came in shining wooden shoes, and in clean blue
working clothes. They were so poor that in the winter
they never had anything to eat but herrings and potatoes,
and it delighted Ditte to give them a really good
meal: sandwiches of the best, and bottles of beer out
of which the cork popped and the froth overflowed.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_V" id="II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
The Little Vagabond</span></h2>


<p>Lars Peter stood by the water-trough where
Klavs was drinking his fill. They had been for
a long trip, and both looked tired and glad to
be home again.</p>

<p>At times a great longing for the highroad came over
the rag and bone man, and he would then harness the
nag and set off on his old rounds again. The road
seemed to ease his trouble, and drew him further and
further away, so that he spent the night from home, returning
the following day. There was not much made
on these trips, but he always managed to do a little&mdash;and
his depression would pass off for the time being.</p>

<p>He had just returned from one of these outings, and
stood in deep thought, happy to be home again, and to
find all was well. Now there should be an end to these
fits of wandering. Affairs at home required a man.</p>

<p>Povl and his sister Else hurried out to welcome him;
they ran in and out between his legs, which to them were
like great thick posts, singing all the while. Sometimes
they would run between the nag's legs too, and the
wise creature would carefully lift its hoofs, as though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
afraid of hurting them&mdash;they could stand erect between
their father's legs.</p>

<p>Ditte came out from the kitchen door with a basket
on her arm. "Now, you're thinking again, father,"
said she laughingly, "take care you don't step on the
children."</p>

<p>Lars Peter pulled himself together and tenderly
stroked the rough little heads. "Where are you off
to?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Oh, to the shop. I want some things for the
house."</p>

<p>"Let Kristian go, you've quite enough to do without
that."</p>

<p>"He hasn't come home from school yet&mdash;most likely
I'll meet him on the way."</p>

<p>"Not home yet?&mdash;and it's nearly supper-time."
Lars Peter looked at her in alarm. "D'you think he
can be off on the highroad again?"</p>

<p>Ditte shook her head. "I think he's been kept in&mdash;I'm
sure to meet him. It's a good thing too&mdash;he can
help me to carry the things home," she added tactfully.</p>

<p>But Lars Peter could no longer be taken in. He had
just been thanking his stars that all was well on his
return, and had silently vowed to give up his wanderings&mdash;and
now this! The boy was at his old tricks
again, there was no doubt about that&mdash;he could see it
in the girl's eyes. It was in his children's blood, it
seemed, and much as he cared for them&mdash;his sins would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
be visited on them. For the little ones' sake he was
struggling to overcome his own wandering bent, and
now it cropped out in them. It was like touching an
open wound&mdash;he felt sick at heart.</p>

<p>Lars Peter led the horse into its stall, and gave it
some corn. He did not take off the harness. Unless
the boy returned soon, he would go and look for him.
It had happened before that Lars Peter and Klavs had
spent the night searching. And once Ditte had nearly
run herself off her legs looking for the boy, while all
the time he was quite happy driving round with his
father on his rounds. He had been waiting for Lars
Peter on the highroad, telling him he had a holiday&mdash;and
got permission to go with his father. There was
no trusting him.</p>

<p>When Ditte got as far as the willows, she hid the
basket in them. She had only used the shop as an
excuse to get away from home and look for the boy,
without the father knowing anything was wrong. A
short distance along the highroad lived some of Kristian's
school-fellows, and she went there to make inquiries.
Kristian had not been at school that day. She
guessed as much&mdash;he had been in such a hurry to get
off in the morning! Perhaps he was in one of the fields,
behind a bush, hungry and wornout; it would be just
like him to lie there until he perished, if no-one found
him in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>She ran aimlessly over the fields, asking every one she
met if they had seen her brother. "Oh, is it the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
scamp from the Crow's Nest?" people asked. "Ay,
he's got vagabond's blood in him."</p>

<p>Then she ran on, as quickly as she could. Her legs
gave way, but she picked herself up and stumbled on.
She couldn't think of going home without the boy;
it would worry her father dreadfully! And Kristian
himself&mdash;her little heart trembled at the thought of his
being out all night.</p>

<p>A man on a cart told her he had seen a boy seven or
eight years old, down by the marsh. She rushed down&mdash;and
there was Kristian. He stood outside a hut,
howling, the inhabitants gathered round him, and a man
holding him firmly by his collar.</p>

<p>"Come to look for this young rascal?" said he.
"Ay, we've caught him, here he is. The children told
he'd shirked his school, and we thought we'd better
make sure of him, to keep him out of mischief."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's all right," said Ditte, bristling, "he
wouldn't do any harm." She pushed the man's hand
away, and like a little mother drew the boy towards her.
"Don't cry, dear," said she, drying his wet cheeks with
her apron. "Nobody'll dare to touch you."</p>

<p>The man grinned and looked taken aback. "Do him
harm?" said he loudly. "And who is it sets fire to
other folk's houses and sets on peaceful womenfolk,
but vagabonds. And that's just the way they
begin."</p>

<p>But Ditte and Kristian had rushed off. She held him
by his hand, scolding him as they went along. "There,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
you can hear yourself what the man says! And that's
what they'll think you are," said she. "And you know
it worries Father so. Don't you think he's enough
trouble without that?"</p>

<p>"Why did Mother do it?" said Kristian, beginning
to cry.</p>

<p>He was worn out, and as soon as they got home
Ditte put him quickly to bed. She gave him camomile
tea and put one of her father's stockings&mdash;the left one&mdash;round
his throat.</p>

<p>During the evening she and her father discussed what
had happened. The boy lay tossing feverishly in bed.
"It's those mischievous children," said Ditte with passion.
"If I were there, they wouldn't dare to touch
him."</p>

<p>"Why does the boy take any notice of it?" growled
Lars Peter. "You've been through it all yourself."</p>

<p>"Ay, but then I'm a girl&mdash;boys mind much more
what's said to them. I give it them back again, but
when Kristian's mad with rage, he can't find anything
to say. And then they all shout and laugh at him&mdash;and
he takes off his wooden shoe to hit them."</p>

<p>Lars Peter sat silent for a while. "We'd better see
and get away from here," said he.</p>

<p>Kristian popped his head over the end of the bed.
"Yes, far, far away!" he shouted. This at all events
he had heard.</p>

<p>"We'll go to America then," said Ditte, carefully
covering him up. "Go to sleep now, so that you'll be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
quite well for the journey." The boy looked at her
with big, trusting eyes, and was quiet.</p>

<p>"'Tis a shame, for the boy's clever enough," whispered
Lars Peter. "'Tis wonderful how he can think
a thing out in his little head&mdash;and understand the ins
and outs of everything. He knows more about wheels
and their workings than I do. If only he hadn't got my
wandering ways in his blood."</p>

<p>"That'll wear off in time!" thought Ditte. "At
one time I used to run away too."</p>

<p>The following day Kristian was out again, and went
singing about the yard. A message had been sent to
school that he was ill, so that he had a holiday for a
few days&mdash;he was in high spirits. He had got hold of
the remains of an old perambulator which his father
had brought home, and was busy mending it, for the
little ones to ride in. Wheels were put on axles, now
only the body remained to be fixed. The two little
ones stood breathlessly watching him. Povl chattered
away, and wanted to help, every other moment his little
hands interfered and did harm. But sister Else stood
dumbly watching, with big thoughtful eyes. "She's
always dreaming, dear little thing," said Ditte, "the
Lord only knows what she dreams about."</p>

<p>Ditte, to all appearance, never dreamed, but went
about wide awake from morning till night. Life had
already given her a woman's hard duties to fulfil, and
she had met them and carried them out with a certain
sturdiness. To the little ones she was the strict house-wife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
and mother, whose authority could not be questioned,
and should the occasion arise, she would give
them a little slap. But underneath the surface was her
childish mind. About all her experiences she formed
her own opinions and conclusions, but never spoke of
them to any one.</p>

<p>The most difficult of all for her to realize was that
Granny was dead, and that she could never, never, run
over to see her any more. Her life with Granny had
been her real childhood, the memory of which remained
vivid&mdash;unforgettable, as happy childhood is
when one is grown up. In the daytime the fact was
clear enough. Granny was dead and buried, and would
never come back again. But at night when Ditte was in
bed, dead-beat after a hard day, she felt a keen desire
to be a child again, and would cuddle herself up in the
quilt, pretending she was with Granny. And, as she
dropped off, she seemed to feel the old woman's arm
round her, as was her wont. Her whole body ached
with weariness, but Granny took it away&mdash;wise Granny
who could cure the rheumatism. Then she would remember
Granny's awful fight with Sörine. And Ditte
would awaken to find Lars Peter standing over her bed
trying to soothe her. She had screamed! He did not
leave her until she had fallen asleep again&mdash;with his
huge hand held against her heart, which fluttered like
that of a captured bird.</p>

<p>At school, she never played, but went about all alone.
The others did not care to have her with them, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
was not good at games either. She was like a hard
fruit, which had had more bad weather than sunshine.
Songs and childish rhymes sounded harsh on her lips,
and her hands were rough with work.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster noticed all this. One day when
Lars Peter was passing, he called him in to talk of
Ditte. "She ought to be in entirely different surroundings,"
said he, "a place where she can get new school-fellows.
Perhaps she has too much responsibility at
home for a child of her age. You ought to send her
away."</p>

<p>To Lars Peter this was like a bomb-shell. He had
a great respect for the schoolmaster&mdash;he had passed
examinations and things&mdash;but how was he to manage
without his clever little housekeeper? "All of us ought
to go away," he thought. "There're only troubles and
worries here."</p>

<p>No, there was nothing to look forward to here&mdash;they
could not even associate with their neighbors! He had
begun to miss the fellowship of men, and often thought
of his relations, whom he had not seen, and hardly
heard of, for many years. He longed for the old
homestead, which he had left to get rid of the family
nickname, and seriously thought of selling the little he
had, and turning homewards. Nicknames seemed to
follow wherever one went. There was no happiness to
be found here, and his livelihood was gone. "Nothing
seems to prosper here," thought he, saving of course the
blessed children&mdash;and they would go with him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>The thought of leaving did not make things better.
Everything was at a standstill. It was no good doing
anything until he began his new life&mdash;whatever that
might be.</p>

<p>He and Ditte talked it over together. She would be
glad to leave, and did not mind where they went. She
had nothing to lose. A new life offered at least the
chance of a more promising future. Secretly, she had
her own ideas of what should come&mdash;but not here; the
place was accursed. Not exactly the prince in Granny's
spinning-song, she was too old for that&mdash;princes only
married princesses. But many other things might happen
besides that, given the opportunity. Ditte had no
great pretensions, but "forward" was her motto. "It
must be a place where there're plenty of people," said
she. "Kind people," she added, thinking most of her
little brothers and sister.</p>

<p>Thus they talked it over until they agreed that it
would be best to sell up as soon as possible and leave.
In the meantime, something happened which for a
time changed their outlook altogether, and made them
forget their plans.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_VI" id="II_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
The Knife-grinder</span></h2>


<p>One afternoon, when the children were playing
outside in the sunshine, Ditte stood just inside
the open kitchen door, washing up after dinner. Suddenly
soft music was heard a short distance away&mdash;a
run of notes; even the sunshine seemed to join in.
The little ones lifted their heads and gazed out into
space; Ditte came out with a plate and a dishcloth in
her hands.</p>

<p>Up on the road just where the track to the Crow's
Nest turned off stood a man with a wonderful-looking
machine; he blew, to draw attention&mdash;on a flute or
clarionet, whatever it might be&mdash;and looked towards
the house. When no-one <a class="corr" name="TC_6" id="TC_6" title="apepared">appeared</a> in answer to his
call, he began moving towards the house, pushing the
machine in front of him. The little ones rushed indoors.
The man left his machine beside the pump and
came up to the kitchen door. Ditte stood barring the
way.</p>

<p>"Anything want grinding, rivetting or soldering,
anything to mend?" he gabbled off, lifting his cap an
inch from his forehead. "I sharpen knives, scissors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
razors, pitchforks or plowshares! Cut your corns, stick
pigs, flirt with the mistress, kiss the maids&mdash;and never
say no to a glass and a crust of bread!" Then he
screwed up his mouth and finished off with a song.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Knives to grind, knives to grind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any scissors and knives to grind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knives and scissors to gri-i-ind!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he sang at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>Ditte stood in the doorway and laughed, with the
children hanging on to her skirt. "I've got a bread-knife
that won't cut," said she.</p>

<p>The man wheeled his machine up to the door. It
was a big thing: water-tank, grindstone, a table for
rivetting, a little anvil and a big wheel&mdash;all built upon
a barrow. The children forgot their fear in their desire
to see this funny machine. He handled the bread-knife
with many flourishes, whistled over the edge to see how
blunt it was, pretended the blade was loose, and put it
on the anvil to rivet it. "It must have been used to
cut paving-stories with," said he. But this was absurd;
the blade was neither loose nor had it been misused.
He was evidently a mountebank.</p>

<p>He was quite young; thin, and quick in his movements;
he rambled on all the time. And such nonsense
he talked! But how handsome he was! He had black
eyes and black hair, which looked quite blue in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Lars Peter came out from the barn yawning; he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
been having an after-dinner nap. There were bits of
clover and hay in his tousled hair. "Where do you
come from?" he cried gaily as he crossed the yard.</p>

<p>"From Spain," answered the man, showing his white
teeth in a broad grin.</p>

<p>"From Spain&mdash;that's what my father always said
when any one asked him," said Lars Peter thoughtfully.
"Don't come from Odsherred by any chance?"</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>"Then maybe you can give me some news of an
Amst Hansen&mdash;a big fellow with nine sons?...
The rag and bone man, he was called." The last was
added guiltily.</p>

<p>"I should think I could&mdash;that's my father."</p>

<p>"No!" said Lars Peter heartily, stretching out his
big hand. "Then welcome here, for you must be
Johannes&mdash;my youngest brother." He held the youth's
hand, looking at him cordially. "Oh, so that's what
you look like now; last time I saw you, you were only
a couple of months old. You're just like mother!"</p>

<p>Johannes smiled rather shyly, and drew his hand
away; he was not so pleased over the meeting as was
his brother.</p>

<p>"Leave the work and come inside," said Lars Peter,
"and the girl will make us a cup of coffee. Well, well!
To think of meeting like this. Ay, just like mother, you
are." He blinked his eyes, touched by the thought.</p>

<p>As they drank their coffee, Johannes told all the news
from home. The mother had died some years ago and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
the brothers were gone to the four corners of the earth.
The news of his mother's death was a great blow to
Lars Peter. "So she's gone?" said he quietly. "I've
not seen her since you were a baby. I'd looked forward
to seeing her again&mdash;she was always good, was
mother."</p>

<p>"Well," Johannes drawled, "she was rather
grumpy."</p>

<p>"Not when I was at home&mdash;maybe she was ill a
long time."</p>

<p>"We didn't get on somehow. No, the old man for
me, he was always in a good temper."</p>

<p>"Does he still work at his old trade?" asked Lars
Peter with interest.</p>

<p>"No, that's done with long ago. He lives on his
pension!" Johannes laughed. "He breaks stones on
the roadside now. He's as hard as ever and will rule
the roost. He fights with the peasants as they pass,
and swears at them because they drive on his heap of
stones."</p>

<p>Johannes himself had quarreled with his master and
had given him a black eye; and as he was the only
butcher who would engage him over there, he had left,
crossing over at Lynoes&mdash;with the machine which he
had borrowed from a sick old scissor-grinder.</p>

<p>"So you're a butcher," said Lars Peter. "I thought
as much. You don't look like a professional grinder.
You're young and strong; couldn't you work for the
old man and keep him out of the workhouse?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he's difficult to get on with&mdash;and he's all right
where he is. If a fellow wants to keep up with the
rest&mdash;and get a little fun out of life&mdash;there's only
enough for one."</p>

<p>"I dare say. And what do you think of doing now?
Going on again?"</p>

<p>Yes, he wanted to see something of life&mdash;with the
help of the machine outside.</p>

<p>"And can you do all you say?"</p>

<p>Johannes made a grimace. "I learned a bit from
the old man when I was a youngster, but it's more by
way of patter than anything else. A fellow's only to
ramble on, get the money, and make off before they've
time to look at the things. It's none so bad, and the
police can't touch you so long as you're working."</p>

<p>"Is that how it is?" said Lars Peter. "I see you've
got the roving blood in you too. 'Tis a sad thing to
suffer from, brother!"</p>

<p>"But why? There's always something new to be
seen! 'Tis sickening to hang about in the same place,
forever."</p>

<p>"Ay, that's what I used to think; but one day a
man finds out that it's no good thinking that way!
Nothing thrives when you knock about the road to earn
your bread. No home and no family, nothing worth
having, however much you try to settle down."</p>

<p>"But you've got both," said Johannes.</p>

<p>"Ay, but it's difficult to keep things together. Living
from hand to mouth and nothing at your back&mdash;'tis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
a poor life. And the worst of it is, we poor folk <i>have</i>
to turn that way; it seems better not to know where
your bread's to come from day by day and go hunting
it here, there and everywhere. It's that that makes us
go a-roving. But now you must amuse yourself for
a couple of hours; I've promised to cart some dung
for a neighbor!"</p>

<p>During Lars Peter's absence Ditte and the children
showed their uncle round the farm. He was a funny
fellow and they very soon made friends. He couldn't
be used to anything fine, for he admired everything he
saw, and won Ditte's confidence entirely. She had
never heard the Crow's Nest and its belongings admired
before.</p>

<p>He helped her with her evening work, and when
Lars Peter returned the place was livelier than it had
been for many a day. After supper Ditte made coffee
and put the brandy bottle on the table, and the brothers
had a long chat. Johannes told about home; he had a
keen sense of humor and spared neither home nor
brothers in the telling, and Lars Peter laughed till he
nearly fell off his chair.</p>

<p>"Ay, that's right enough!" he cried, "just as it
would have been in the old days." There was a great
deal to ask about and many old memories to be refreshed;
the children had not seen their father so
genial and happy for goodness knows how long. It was
easy to see that his brother's coming had done him
good.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>And they too had a certain feeling of well-being&mdash;they
had got a relation! Since Granny's death they had
seemed so alone, and when other children spoke of their
relations they had nothing to say. They had got an
uncle&mdash;next after a granny this was the greatest of all
relations. And he had come to the Crow's Nest in the
most wonderful manner, taking them unawares&mdash;and
himself too! Their little bodies tingled with excitement;
every other minute they crept out, meddling with
the wonderful machine, which was outside sleeping in
the moonlight. But Ditte soon put a stop to this and
ordered them to bed.</p>

<p>The two brothers sat chatting until after midnight,
and the children struggled against sleep as long as they
possibly could, so as not to lose anything. But sleep
overcame them at last, and Ditte too had to give in.
She would not go to bed before the men, and fell asleep
over the back of a chair.</p>

<p>Morning came, and with it a sense of joy; the children
opened their eyes with the feeling that something
had been waiting for them by the bedside the whole
night to meet them with gladness when they woke&mdash;what
was it? Yes, over there on the hook by the
door hung a cap&mdash;Uncle Johannes was here! He and
Lars Peter were already up and doing.</p>

<p>Johannes was taken with everything he saw and was
full of ideas. "This might be made a nice little property,"
he said time after time. "'Tis neglected, that's
all."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, it's had to look after itself while I've been
out," answered Lars Peter in excuse. "And this
trouble with the wife didn't make things better either.
Maybe you've heard all about it over there?"</p>

<p>Johannes nodded. "That oughtn't to make any
difference to you, though," said he.</p>

<p>That day Lars Peter had to go down to the marsh
and dig a ditch, to drain a piece of the land. Johannes
got a spade and went with him. He worked with such
a will that Lars Peter had some difficulty in keeping
up with him. "'Tis easy to see you're young," said he,
"the way you go at it."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ditch the whole and level it out?
'Twould make a good meadow," said Johannes.</p>

<p>Ay, why not? Lars Peter did not know himself.
"If only a fellow had some one to work with," said he.</p>

<p>"Do you get any peat here?" asked Johannes once
when they were taking a breathing space.</p>

<p>"No, nothing beyond what we use ourselves; 'tis a
hard job to cut it."</p>

<p>"Ay, when you use your feet! But you ought to
get a machine to work with a horse; then a couple of
men can do ever so many square feet in a day."</p>

<p>Lars Peter became thoughtful. Ideas and advice
had been poured into him and he would have liked to
go thoroughly through them and digest them one by
one. But Johannes gave him no time.</p>

<p>The next minute he was by the clay-pit. There was
uncommonly fine material for bricks, he thought.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Ay, Lars Peter knew it all only too well. The first
summer he was married, Sörine had made bricks to
build the outhouse and it had stood all kinds of weather.
But one pair of hands could not do everything.</p>

<p>And thus Johannes went from one thing to the other.
He was observant and found ways for everything; there
was no end to his plans. Lars Peter had to attend; it
was like listening to an old, forgotten melody. Marsh,
clay-pit and the rest had said the same year after year,
though more slowly; now he had hardly time to follow.
It was inspiriting, all at once to see a way out of all difficulties.</p>

<p>"Look here, brother," said he, as they were at
dinner, "you put heart into a man again. How'd
you like to stay on here? Then we could put the place
in order together. There's not much in that roving
business after all."</p>

<p>Johannes seemed to like the idea&mdash;after all, the highroad
was unsatisfactory as a means of livelihood!</p>

<p>During the day they talked it over more closely and
agreed how to set about things; they would share as
brothers both the work and what it brought in. "But
what about the machine?" said Lars Peter. "That
must be returned."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind that," said Johannes. "The man
can't use it; he's ill."</p>

<p>"Ay, but when he gets up again, then he'll have
nothing to earn his living; we can't have that on our
conscience. I'm going down to the beach tomorrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
for a load of herrings, so I'll drive round by Hundested
and put it off there. There's sure to be a fisherman
who'll take it over with him. I'd really thought of
giving up the herring trade; but long ago I bound myself
to take a load, and there should be a good catch
these days."</p>

<p>At three o'clock next morning Lars Peter was ready
in the yard to drive to the fishing village; at the back
of the cart was the wonderful machine. As he was
about to start, Johannes came running up, unwashed
and only half awake; he had just managed to put on
his cap and tie a handkerchief round his neck. "I think
I'll go with you," he said with a yawn.</p>

<p>Lars Peter thought for a minute&mdash;it came as a
surprise to him. "Very well, just as you like," said
he at last, making room. He had reckoned on his
brother beginning the ditching today; there was so little
water in the meadow now.</p>

<p>"Do me good to get out a bit!" said Johannes as he
clambered into the cart.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;yes&mdash;but he had only just come in. "Don't
you want an overcoat?" asked Lars Peter. "There's
an old one of mine you can have."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind&mdash;I can turn up my collar."</p>

<p>The sun was just rising; there was a white haze on
the shores of the lake, hanging like a veil over the
rushes. In the green fields dewdrops were caught by
millions in the spiders' webs, sparkling like diamonds in
the first rays of sunshine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>Lars Peter saw it all, and perhaps it was this which
turned his mind; at least, today, he thought the Crow's
Nest was a good and pretty little place; it would be a
sin to leave it. He had found out all he wanted to
know about his relations and home and what had
happened to every one in the past years and his longing
for home had vanished; now he would prefer to stay
where he was. "Just you be thankful that you're
away from it all!" Johannes had said. And he was
right&mdash;it wasn't worth while moving to go back to the
quarreling and jealousies of relations. As a matter
of fact there was no inducement to leave: no sense in
chasing your luck like a fool, better try to keep what
there was.</p>

<p>Lars Peter could not understand what had happened
to him&mdash;everything looked so different today. It was
as if his eyes had been rubbed with some wonderful ointment;
even the meager lands of the Crow's Nest looked
beautiful and promising. A new day had dawned for
him and his home.</p>

<p>"'Tis a glorious morning," said he, turning towards
Johannes.</p>

<p>Johannes did not answer. He had drawn his cap
down over his eyes and gone to sleep. He looked somewhat
dejected and his mouth hung loosely as if he had
been drinking. It was extraordinary how he resembled
his mother! Lars Peter promised himself that he
would take good care of him.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_VII" id="II_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
The Sausage-maker</span></h2>


<p>Nothing was done to the land round the Crow's
Nest this time; it was a fateful moment when
Johannes, instead of taking his spade and beginning
the ditching, felt inclined to go with his brother carting
herrings. On one of the farms where they went
to trade, a still-born calf lay outside the barn; Johannes
caught sight of it at once. With one jump he was out
of the cart and beside it.</p>

<p>"What do you reckon to do with it?" asked he,
turning it over with his foot.</p>

<p>"Bury it, of course," answered the farm-lad.</p>

<p>"Don't folks sell dead animals in these parts?"
asked Johannes when they were in the cart again.</p>

<p>"Why, who could they sell them to?" answered
Lars Peter.</p>

<p>"The Lord preserve me, you're far behind the times.
D'you know what, I've a good mind to settle down here
as a cattle-dealer."</p>

<p>"And buy up all the still-born calves?" Lars Peter
laughed.</p>

<p>"Not just that. But it's not a bad idea, all the same;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the old butcher at home often made ten to fifteen crowns
out of a calf like that."</p>

<p>"I thought we were going to start in earnest at
home," said Lars Peter.</p>

<p>"We'll do that too, but we shall want money! Your
trade took up all your time, so everything was left to
look after itself, but cattle-dealing's another thing. A
hundred crowns a day's easily earned, if you're lucky.
Let me drive round once a week, and I'll promise it'll
give us enough to live on. And then we've the rest of
the week to work on the land."</p>

<p>"Sounds all right," said Lars Peter hesitatingly.
"There's trader's blood in you too, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"You may be sure of that, I've often earned hundreds
of crowns for my master at home in Knarreby."</p>

<p>"But how'd you begin?" said Peter. "I've got
fifty crowns at the most, and that's not much to buy
cattle with. It's put by for rent and taxes, and really
oughtn't to be touched."</p>

<p>"Let me have it, and I'll see to the rest," said
Johannes confidently.</p>

<p>The very next day he set off in the cart, with the
whole of Lars Peter's savings in his pocket. He was
away for two days, which was not reassuring in itself.
Perhaps he had got into bad company, and had the
money stolen from him&mdash;or frittered it away in poor
trade. The waiting began to seem endless to Lars
Peter. Then at last Johannes returned, with a full
load and singing at the top of his voice. To the back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of the cart was tied an old half-dead horse, so far gone
it could hardly move.</p>

<p>"Well, you seem to have bought something young!"
shouted Lars Peter scoffingly. "What've you got
under the sacks and hay?"</p>

<p>Johannes drove the cart into the porch, closed the
gates, and began to unload. A dead calf, a half-rotten
pig and another calf just alive. He had bought them
on the neighboring farms, and had still some money
left.</p>

<p>"Ay, that's all very well, but what are you going to
do with it all?" broke out Lars Peter amazed.</p>

<p>"You'll see that soon enough," answered Johannes,
running in and out.</p>

<p>There was dash and energy in him, he sang and
whistled, as he bustled about. The big porch was
cleared, and a tree-stump put in as a block; he lit a
wisp of hay to see if there was a draught underneath
the boiler. The children stood open-mouthed gazing
at him, and Lars Peter shook his head, but did not
interfere.</p>

<p>He cut up the dead calf, skinned it, and nailed the
skin up in the porch to dry. Then it was the sick calf's
turn, with one blow it was killed, and its skin hung up
beside the other.</p>

<p>Ditte and Kristian were set to clean the guts, which
they did very unwillingly.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, have you never touched guts before?"
said Johannes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"A-a-y. But not of animals that had died," answered
Ditte.</p>

<p>"Ho, indeed, so you clean the guts while they're
alive, eh? I'd like to see that!"</p>

<p>They had no answer ready, and went on with their
work&mdash;while Johannes drew in the half-dead horse, and
went for the ax. As he ran across the yard, he threw
the ax up into the air and caught it again by the handle;
he was in high spirits.</p>

<p>"Takes after the rest of the family!" thought Lars
Peter, who kept in the barn, and busied himself there.
He did not like all this, although it was the trade his
race had practised for many years, and which now
took possession of the Crow's Nest; it reminded
him strongly of his childhood. "Folk may well
think us the scum of the earth now," thought he
moodily.</p>

<p>Johannes came whistling into the barn for an old
sack.</p>

<p>"Don't look so grumpy, old man," said he as he
passed. Lars Peter had not time to answer before he
was out again. He put the sack over the horse's head,
measured the distance, and swung the ax backwards;
a strange long-drawn crash sounded from behind the
sack, and the horse sank to the ground with its skull
cracked. The children looked on, petrified.</p>

<p>"You'll have to give me a hand now, to lift it,"
shouted Johannes gaily. Lars Peter came lingeringly
across the yard, and gave a helping hand. Shortly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
afterwards the horse hung from a beam, with its head
downwards, the body was cut up and the skin folded
back like a cape.</p>

<p>Uncle Johannes' movements became more and more
mysterious. They understood his care with the skins,
these could be sold; but what did he want with the
guts and all the flesh he cut up? That evening he lit
the fire underneath the boiler, and he worked the whole
night, filling the place with a disgusting smell of bones,
meat and guts being cooked.</p>

<p>"He must be making soap," thought Lars Peter, "or
cart grease."</p>

<p>The more he thought of it the less he liked the whole
proceeding, and wished that he had let his brother go
as he had come. But he could do nothing now, but
let him go on.</p>

<p>Johannes asked no one to help him; he kept the
door of the outhouse carefully closed and did his
work with great secrecy. He was cooking the whole
night, and the next morning at breakfast he ordered the
children not to say a word of what he had been doing.
During the morning he disappeared and returned with
a mincing-machine, he took the block too into the outhouse.
He came to his meals covered with blood, fat
and scraps of meat. He looked dreadful and smelled
even worse. But he certainly worked hard; he did not
even allow himself time to sleep.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon he opened the door of the
outhouse wide: the work was done.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here you are, come and look!" he shouted. From
a stick under the ceiling hung a long row of sausages,
beautiful to look at, bright and freshly colored; no-one
would guess what they were made of. On the big
washing-board lay meat, cut into neat joints and bright
red in color&mdash;this was the best part of the horse. And
there was a big pail of fat, which had not quite stiffened.
"That's grease," said Johannes, stirring it, "but as a
matter of fact it's quite nice for dripping. Looks quite
tasty, eh?"</p>

<p>"It shan't come into our kitchen," said Ditte, making
a face at the things.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid, my girl; sausage-makers
never eat their own meat," answered Johannes.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with it now?" asked
Lars Peter, evidently knowing what the answer would
be.</p>

<p>"Sell it, of course!" Johannes showed his white
teeth, as he took a sausage. "Just feel how firm and
round it is."</p>

<p>"If you think you can sell them here, you're very
much mistaken. You don't know the folks in these
parts."</p>

<p>"Here? of course not! Drive over to the other side
of the lake where no-one knows me, or what they're
made of. We often used to make these at my old
place. All the bad stuff we bought in one county, we
sold in another. No-one ever found us out. Simple
enough, isn't it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll have nothing to do with it," said Lars Peter
determinedly.</p>

<p>"Don't want you to&mdash;you're not the sort for this
work. I'm off <a class="corr" name="TC_7" id="TC_7" title="tomorrw">tomorrow</a>, but you must get me another
horse. If I have to drive with that rusty old threshing-machine
in there, I shan't be back for a whole week.
Never saw such a beast. If he was mine I'd make him
into sausages."</p>

<p>"That you shall never do," answered Lars Peter
offendedly. "The horse is good enough, though maybe
he's not to your liking."</p>

<p>The fact was they did not suit each other&mdash;Johannes
and Klavs; they were like fire and water. Johannes
preferred to fly along the highroad; but soon found out
it wouldn't do. Then he expected that the nag&mdash;since
it could no longer gallop and was so slow to set going&mdash;should
keep moving when he jumped off. As a butcher
he was accustomed to jump off the cart, run into a
house with a piece of meat, catch up with the cart
and jump on again&mdash;without stopping the horse. But
Klavs did not feel inclined for these new tricks. The
result was they clashed. Johannes made up his mind to
train the horse, and kept striking it with the thick end of
the whip. Klavs stopped in amazement. Twice he kicked
up his hind legs&mdash;warningly, then turned round, broke
the shafts, and tried to get up into the cart. He showed
his long teeth in a grin, which might mean: Just let me
get you under my hoofs, you black rascal! This happened
on the highroad the day he had gone out to buy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
cattle. Lars Peter and the children knew that the
two were enemies. When Johannes entered the barn,
Klavs at once laid back his ears and was prepared to
both bite and fight. There was no mistaking the signs.</p>

<p>Next morning, before Johannes started out, Kristian
was sent over with the nag to a neighbor who lived
north of the road, and got their horse in exchange.</p>

<p>"It belonged to a butcher for many years, so you
ought to get on with it," said Lars Peter as they
harnessed it.</p>

<p>It was long and thin, just the sort for Johannes. As
soon as he was in the cart, the horse knew what kind of
man held the reins. It set off with a jerk, and passed
the corner of the house like a flash of lightning. The
next minute they were up on the highroad, rushing
along in a whirl of dust. Johannes bumped up and
down on the seat, shouted and flourished his whip, and
held the reins over his head. They seemed possessed
by the devil.</p>

<p>"He shan't touch Klavs again," mumbled Lars Peter
as he went in.</p>

<p>The next day Johannes came back with notes in his
pocketbook and a mare running behind the cart. It was
the same kind of horse as the one he drove, only a little
more stiff in its movements; he had bought it for next to
nothing&mdash;to be killed.</p>

<p>"But it would be a sin to kill it; it's not too far gone
to enjoy life yet, eh, old lady?" said he, slapping its
back. The mare whinnied and threw up its hind legs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis nigh on thirty," said Lars Peter, peering into
its mouth.</p>

<p>"It may not be up to much, but the will's there
right enough, just look at it!" He cracked his whip
and the old steed threw its head back and started off.
It didn't get very far, however, its movements were
jerky and painful.</p>

<p>"Quite a high flier," said Lars Peter laughingly, "it
looks as if a breath of air would blow it up to heaven.
But are you sure it's not against the law to use it, when
it's sold to be killed?"</p>

<p>Johannes nodded. "They won't know it when I've
finished with it," said he.</p>

<p>As soon as he had had a meal, and got into his working
clothes, he started to remodel the horse. He
clipped its mane and tail, and cropped the hair round
its hoofs.</p>

<p>"It only wants a little brown coloring to dye the
gray hair&mdash;and a couple of bottles of arsenic, and
then you'll see how smart and young she'll be. The
devil himself wouldn't know her again."</p>

<p>"Did you learn these tricks from your master?"
asked Lars Peter.</p>

<p>"No, from the old man. Never seen him at it?"</p>

<p>Lars Peter could not remember. "It must have
been after my time," said he, turning away.</p>

<p>"'Tis a good old family trick," said Johannes.</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>That there was money to be made from the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
business was soon evident, and Lars Peter got over his
indignation. He let Johannes drive round buying and
selling, while he himself remained at home, making
sausages, soap and grease from the refuse. He had
been an apt pupil, it was the old family trade.</p>

<p>The air round the Crow's Nest stank that summer.
People held their noses and whipped up their horses as
they passed by. Johannes brought home money in
plenty and they lacked for nothing. But neither Lars
Peter nor the children were happy. They felt that the
Crow's Nest was talked about more even than before.
And the worst of it was, they no longer felt this to be
an injustice. People had every right to look down on
them now; there was not the consolation that their
honor was unassailable.</p>

<p>Johannes did not care. He was out on the road most
of the time. He made a lot of money, and was proud
of it too. He often bought cattle and sold them again.
He was dissipated, so it was said&mdash;played cards with
fellows of his own kidney, and went to dances. Sometimes
after a brawl, he would come home with a wounded
head and a black eye. Apparently he spent a
great deal of money; no-one could say how much he
made. That was his business, but he behaved as if he
alone kept things going, and was easily put out. Lars
Peter never interfered, he liked peace in the house.</p>

<p>One day, however, they quarreled in earnest.
Johannes had always had his eye on the nag, and one
day when Lars Peter was away, he dragged it out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the stall and tied it up, he was going to teach it to
behave, he said to the children. With difficulty he
harnessed it to the cart, it lashed its tail and showed its
teeth, and when Johannes wanted it to set off, refused
to stir, however much it was lashed. At last, beside
himself with temper, he jumped off the cart, seized a
shaft from the harrow, and began hitting at its legs
with all <a class="corr" name="TC_8" id="TC_8" title="its">his</a> might. The children screamed. The horse
was trembling, bathed in perspiration, its flanks heaving
violently. Each time he jumped up to it, the nag
kicked up its hind legs, and at last giving up the fight,
Johannes threw away his weapon and went into his
room.</p>

<p>Ditte had tried to throw herself between them, but
had been brushed aside; now she went up to the horse.
She unharnessed it, gave it water to drink, and put a wet
sack over its wounds, while the little ones stood round
crying and offering it bread. Shortly afterwards
Johannes came out; he had changed his clothes.
Quickly, without a look at any one, he harnessed and
drove off. The little ones came out from their hiding-place
and gazed after him.</p>

<p>"Is he going away now?" asked sister Else.</p>

<p>"I only wish he would, or the horse bolt, so he could
never find his way back again, nasty brute," said Kristian.
None of them liked him any longer.</p>

<p>A man came along the footpath down by the marsh,
it was their father. The children ran to meet him, and
all started to tell what had happened. Lars Peter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
stared at them for a moment, as if he could not take
in what they had said, then set off at a run; Ditte
followed him into the stable. There stood Klavs, looking
very miserable; the poor beast still trembled when
they spoke to it; its body was badly cut. Lars Peter's
face was gray.</p>

<p>"He may thank the Lord that he's not here now!"
he said to Ditte. He examined the horse's limbs to
make sure no bones were broken; the nag carefully
lifted one leg, then the other, and moaned.</p>

<p>"Blood-hound," said Lars Peter, softly stroking its
legs, "treating poor old Klavs like that."</p>

<p>Klavs whinnied and scraped the stones with his
hoofs. He took advantage of his master's sympathy
and begged for an extra supply of corn.</p>

<p>"You should give him a good beating," said Kristian
seriously.</p>

<p>"I've a mind to turn him out altogether," answered
the father darkly. "'Twould be best for all of us."</p>

<p>"Yes, and d'you know, Father? Can you guess why
the Johansens haven't been to see us this summer?
They're afraid of what we'll give them to eat; they say
we make food from dead animals."</p>

<p>"Where did you hear that, Ditte?" Lars Peter
looked at her in blank despair.</p>

<p>"The children shouted it after me today. They
asked if I wouldn't like a dead cat to make sausages."</p>

<p>"Ay, I thought as much," he laughed miserably.
"Well, we can do without them,&mdash;what the devil do I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
want with them!" he shouted so loudly that little Povl
began to cry.</p>

<p>"Hush now, I didn't mean to frighten you," Lars
Peter took him in his arms. "But it's enough to make
a man lose his temper."</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, Johannes returned home, looking
as dirty and rakish as he possibly could. Lars Peter
had to help him out of the cart, he could hardly stand
on his legs. But he was not at loss for words. Lars
Peter was silent at his insolence and dragged him into
the barn, where he at once fell asleep. There he lay
like a dead beast, deathly white, with a lock of black
hair falling over his brow, and plastered on his forehead&mdash;he
looked a wreck. The children crept over to
the barn-door and peered at him through the half dark;
when they caught sight of him they rushed out with
terror into the fields. It was too horrible.</p>

<p>Lars Peter went to and fro, cutting hay for the
horses. As he passed his brother, he stopped, and
looked at him thoughtfully. That was how a man
should look to keep up with other people: smooth and
polished outside, and cold and heartless inside. No-one
looked down on him just because he had impudence.
Women admired him, and made some excuse to pass on
the highroad in the evenings, and as for the men&mdash;his
dissipation and his fights over girls probably overwhelmed
them.</p>

<p>Lars Peter put his hand into his brother's pocket and
took out the pocketbook&mdash;it was empty! He had taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
150 crowns with him from their joint savings&mdash;to be
used for buying cattle, it was all the money there was
in the house; and now he had squandered it all.</p>

<p>His hands began to tremble. He leant over his
brother, as if to seize him; but straightened himself and
left the barn. He hung about for two or three hours, to
give his brother time to sleep off the drink, then went in
again. This time he would settle up. He shook his
brother and wakened him.</p>

<p>"Where's the money to buy the calf?" asked he.</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" Johannes threw himself on
his other side.</p>

<p>Lars Peter dragged him to his feet. "I want to
speak to you," said he.</p>

<p>"Oh, go to hell," mumbled Johannes. He did not
open his eyes, and tumbled back into the hay.</p>

<p>Lars Peter brought a pail of ice-cold water from the
well.</p>

<p>"I'll wake you, whether you like it or not!" said he,
throwing the pailful of water over his head.</p>

<p>Like a cat Johannes sprang to his feet, and drew his
knife. He turned round, startled by the rude awakening;
caught sight of his brother and rushed at him.
Lars Peter felt a stab in his cheek, the blade of the
knife struck against his teeth. With one blow he
knocked Johannes down, threw himself on him,
wrestling for the knife. Johannes was like a cat, strong
and quick in his movements; he twisted and turned,
used his teeth, and tried to find an opening to stab
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
again. He was foaming at the mouth. Lars Peter
warded off the attacks with his hands, which were
bleeding already from several stabs. At last he got his
knee on his brother's chest.</p>

<p>Johannes lay gasping for breath. "Let me go!"
he hissed.</p>

<p>"Ay, if you'll behave properly," said Lars Peter,
relaxing his grip a little. "You're my youngest
brother, and I'm loth to harm you; but I'll not be
knocked down like a pig by you."</p>

<p>With a violent effort Johannes tried to throw off his
brother. He got one arm free, and threw himself to
one side, reaching for the knife, which lay a good
arm's length away.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's your game!" said Lars Peter, forcing
him down on to the floor of the barn with all his
weight, "I'd better tie you up. Bring a rope, children!"</p>

<p>The three stood watching outside the barn-door; one
behind the other. "Come on!" shouted the father.
Then Kristian rushed in for Ditte, and she brought a
rope. Without hesitation she went up to the two struggling
men, and gave it to her father. "Shall I help
you?" said she.</p>

<p>"No need for that, my girl," said Lars Peter, and
laughed. "Just hold the rope, while I turn him over."</p>

<p>He bound his brother's hands firmly behind his back,
then set him on his feet and brushed him. "You look
like a pig," said he, "you must have been rolling on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
muddy road. Go indoors quietly or you'll be sorry for
it. No fault of yours that you're not a murderer
today."</p>

<p>Johannes was led in, and set down in the rush-bottomed
armchair beside the fire. The children were sent
out of doors, and Ditte and Kristian ordered to harness
Uncle Johannes' horse.</p>

<p>"Now we're alone, I'll tell you that you've behaved
like a scoundrel," said Lars Peter slowly. "Here have
I been longing for many a year to see some of my own
kin, and when you came it was like a message from
home. I'd give much never to have had it now. All of
us saw something good in you; we didn't expect much,
so there wasn't much for you to live up to. But what
have you done? Dragged us into a heap of filth and
villainy and wickedness. We've done with you here&mdash;make
no mistake about that. You can take the one
horse and cart and whatever else you can call your own,
and off you go! There's no money to be got; you've
wasted more than you've earned."</p>

<p>Johannes made no answer, and avoided his brother's
eyes.</p>

<p>The cart was driven up outside. Lars Peter led him
out, and lifted him like a child on to the seat. He
loosened the rope with his cut and bleeding hands; the
blood from the wound on his cheek ran down on to his
chin and clothes. "Get off with you," said he threateningly,
wiping the blood from his chin, "and be smart
about it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Johannes sat for a moment swaying in the cart, as if
half asleep. Suddenly he pulled himself together, and
with a shout of laughter gathered up the reins and
quickly set off round the corner of the house up to the
highroad.</p>

<p>Lars Peter stood gazing after the horse and cart,
then went in and washed off the blood. Ditte bathed
his wounds in cold water and put on sticking-plaster.</p>

<p>For the next few days they were busy getting rid of
all traces of that summer's doings. Lars Peter dug
down the remainder of the refuse, threw the block
away, and cleaned up. When some farmer or other
at night knocked on the window-panes with his whip,
shouting: "Lars Peter, I've got a dead animal for
you!" he made no answer. No more sausage-making,
no more trading in carrion for him!</p>

The Last Of The Crow's Nest</span></h2>


<p>Ditte went about singing at her work; she had
no-one to help her, and ran about to and fro.
One eye was bound up, and each time she crossed
the kitchen she lifted the bandage and bathed
her eye with something brown in a cup. The eye was
bloodshot, and hurt, and showed the colors of the
rainbow, but all the same she was happy. Indeed, it
was the sore eye which put her in such a happy mood.
They were going away from the Crow's Nest, right
away and forever, and it was all on account of her
eye.</p>

<p>Lars Peter came home; he had been out for a walk.
He hung up his stick behind the kitchen door. "Well,
how's the eye getting on?" he asked, as he began to
take off his boots.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's much better now. And what did the schoolmaster
say?"</p>

<p>"Ay, what did he say? He thought it good and
right that you should stand up for your little brothers
and sister. But he did not care to be mixed up in the
affair, and after all 'tis not to be wondered at."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not? He knows how it all happened&mdash;and
he's so truthful!"</p>

<p>"Hm&mdash;well&mdash;truthful! When a well-to-do farmer's
son's concerned, then&mdash;&mdash;. He's all right, but he's got
his living to make. He's afraid of losing his post, if
he gets up against the farmers, and they hang together
like peas in a pod. He advised me to let it drop&mdash;especially
as we're leaving the place. Nothing would
come of it but trouble and rows again. And maybe it's
likely enough. They'd get their own back at the auction&mdash;agree
not to bid the things up, or stay away altogether."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't go to the police about it?"</p>

<p>"Ay, but I did. But he thought too there wasn't
much to be made of the case. Oh, and the schoolmaster
said you needn't go to school for the rest of
the time&mdash;he'd see it was all right. He's a kind man,
even if he is afraid of his skin."</p>

<p>Ditte was not satisfied. It would have done the big
boy good to be well punished. He had been the first
to attack Kristian, and had afterwards kicked her in her
eye with his wooden shoe, because she had stood up
for her brother. And she had been certain in her
childish mind that this time they would get compensation&mdash;for
the law made no difference whoever the
people were.</p>

<p>"If I'd been a rich farmer's daughter, and he had
come from the Crow's Nest, what then?" she asked
hoarsely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he'd have got a good thrashing&mdash;if not
worse!" said the father. "That's the way we poor
people are treated, and can only be thankful that we
don't get fined into the bargain."</p>

<p>"If you meet the boy, won't you give him a good
thrashing?" she asked shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>"I'd rather give it to his father&mdash;but it's better to
keep out of it. We're of no account, you see!"</p>

<p>Kristian came in through the kitchen door. "When
I'm bigger, then I'll creep back here at night and set
fire to his farm," said he, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"What's that you say, boy&mdash;d'you want to send
us all to jail?" shouted Lars Peter, aghast.</p>

<p>"'Twould do them good," said Ditte, setting to work
again. She was very dissatisfied with the result of her
father's visit.</p>

<p>"When're you going to arrange about the auction?"
she said stiffly.</p>

<p>"They'll see to that," answered Lars Peter quickly,
"I've seen the clerk about it. He was very kind."
Lars Peter was grateful for this, he did not care to go
to the magistrate.</p>

<p>"Ay, he's glad to get rid of us," said Ditte harshly.
"That's what they all are. At school they make a ring
and sing about a crow and an owl and all ugly birds!
and the crow and his young steal the farmer's chickens,
but then the farmer takes a long stick and pulls down
the Crow's Nest. Do you think I don't know what they
mean?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Lars Peter was silent, and went back to his work.
He too felt miserable now.</p>

<p>But in the evening, as they sat round the lamp, talking
of the future, all unpleasantness was forgotten.
Lars Peter had been looking round for a place to settle
down in, and had fixed on the fishing-hamlet where he
used to buy fish in the old days. The people seemed to
like him, and had often asked him why he didn't settle
down there. "And there's a jolly fellow there, the
inn-keeper, he can do anything. He's rough till you
get to know him, but he's got a kind heart. He's
promised to find me a couple of rooms, until we can
build a place for ourselves&mdash;and help me to a share in
a boat. What we get from the auction ought to be
enough to build a house."</p>

<p>"Is that the man you told us about, who's like a
dwarf?" asked Ditte with interest.</p>

<p>"Ay, he's like a giant and a dwarf mixed together&mdash;so
to say&mdash;he might well have had the one for a
father and the other for a mother. He's hunch-backed
in front and behind, and his face as black as a crow's,
but he can't help that, and otherwise he's all right.
He's a finger in everything down there."</p>

<p>Ditte shuddered. "Sounds like a goblin!" said she.</p>

<p>Lars Peter was going in for fishing now. He had
had a great deal to do in this line during his life, but
he himself had never gone out; his fingers itched to be
at it. Ditte too liked the thought of it. Then she
would be near the sea again, which she dimly remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
from her childhood with Granny. And they
would have done with everything here, and perhaps get
rid of the rag and bone name, and shake off the curse.</p>

<p>Then they had to decide what to take with them.
Now that it came to the point, it was dreadful to part
with one's possessions. When they had gone through
things together, and written on Kristian's slate what
was to be sold, there wasn't much put down. They
would like to take it all with them.</p>

<p>"We must go through it again&mdash;and have no nonsense,"
said Lars Peter. "We can't take the whole
bag of tricks with us. Money'll be needed too&mdash;and
not so little either."</p>

<p>So they went over the things again one by one. Klavs
was out of the question. It would be a shame to send
him to strangers in his old age; they could feed him
on the downs. "It's useful to have," thought Lars
Peter; "it gives a man a better standing. And we
can make a little money by him too." This was only
said by way of comfort. Deep down in his heart, he
was very anxious about the nag. But no-one could face
the thought of being parted from it.</p>

<p>The cow, on the other hand, there was quite a battle
about. Lars Peter wished to take it too. "It's served
us faithfully all this while," said he, "and given the
little ones their food and health. And it's good to
have plenty of milk in the house." But here Ditte was
sensible. If they took the cow, they would have to take
a field as well.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>Lars Peter laughed: Ay, that was not a bad idea, if
only they could take a lump of meadow on the cart&mdash;and
piece of the marsh. Down there, there was nothing
but sand. Well, he would give up the cow. "But the
pig we'll keep&mdash;and the hens!"</p>

<p>Ditte agreed that hens were useful to keep, and the
pig could live on anything.</p>

<p>The day before the auction they were busily engaged
in putting all in order and writing numbers on the
things in chalk. The little ones helped too, and were
full of excitement.</p>

<p>"But they're not all matched," said Ditte, pointing
at the different lots Lars Peter had put up
together.</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter," answered Lars Peter&mdash;"folks
see there's a boot in one lot, bid it up and then
buy the whole lot. Well, then they see the other boot
in another lot&mdash;and bid that up as well. It's always like
that at auctions; folks get far more than they have use
for&mdash;and most of it doesn't match."</p>

<p>Ditte laughed: "Ay, you ought to know all about
it!" Her father himself had the bad habit of going to
auctions and bringing home a great deal of useless
rubbish. It could be bought on credit, which was a
temptation.</p>

<p>How things collected as years went by, in attics and
outhouses! It was a relief to get it all cleared away.
But it was difficult to keep it together. The children
had a use for it all&mdash;as soon as they saw their opportunity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
they would run off with something or other&mdash;just
like rats.</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>The day of the auction arrived&mdash;a mild, gray, damp
October day. The soft air hung like a veil over everything.
The landscape, with its scattered houses and
trees, lay resting in the all-embracing wet.</p>

<p>At the Crow's Nest they had been early astir. Ditte
and Lars Peter had been running busily about from
the house to the barn and back again. Now they had
finished, and everything was in readiness. The children
were washed and dressed, and went round full of expectation,
with well-combed heads and faces red from
scrubbing and soap. Ditte did not do things by halves,
and when she washed their ears, and made their eyes
smart with the soap, weeping was unavoidable. But
now the disagreeable task was over, and there would
be no more of it for another week; childish tears dry
quickly, and their little faces beamingly met the day.</p>

<p>Little Povl was last ready. Ditte could hardly keep
him on the chair, as she put the finishing touches&mdash;he
was anxious to be out. "Well, what d'you say to
sister?" she asked, when he was done, offering her
mouth.</p>

<p>"Hobble!" said he, looking roguishly at her; he was
in high spirits. Kristian and Else laughed.</p>

<p>"No, now answer properly," said Ditte seriously;
she did not allow fun when correcting them. "Say,
'thank you, dear'&mdash;well?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, dear lump!" said the youth, laughing
immoderately.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're mad today," said Ditte, lifting him
down. He ran out into the yard to the father, and continued
his nonsense.</p>

<p>"What's that he says?" shouted Lars Peter from
outside.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's only something he's made up himself&mdash;he
often does that. He seems to think it's something
naughty."</p>

<p>"You, lumpy, lump!" said the child, taking hold
of his father's leg.</p>

<p>"Mind what you're doing, you little monkey, or I'll
come after you!" said Lars Peter with a terrible roar.</p>

<p>The boy laughed and hid behind the well.</p>

<p>Lars Peter caught him and put him on one shoulder,
and his sister on the other. "We'll go in the fields,"
said he.</p>

<p>Ditte and Kristian went with him, it would be their
last walk there; involuntarily they each took hold of
his coat. Thus they went down the pathway to the
clay-pit, past the marsh and up on the other side. It
was strange how different everything looked now they
were going to lose it. The marsh and the clay-pit could
have told their own tale about the children's play and
Lars Peter's plans. The brambles in the hedges, the
large stone which marked the boundary, the stone behind
which they used to hide&mdash;all spoke to them in their
own way today. The winter seed was in the earth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
everything ready for the new occupier, whoever he
might be. Lars Peter did not wish his successor to
have anything to complain of. No-one should say that
he had neglected his land, because he was not going to
reap the harvest.</p>

<p>"Ay, our time's up here," said he, when they were
back in the house again. "Lord knows what the new
place'll be like!" There was a catch in his voice as he
spoke.</p>

<p>A small crowd began to collect on the highroad.
They stood in groups and did not go down to the
Crow's Nest, until the auctioneer and his clerk arrived.
Ditte was on the point of screaming when she saw who
the two men were; they were the same who had come
to fetch her mother. But now they came on quite a
different errand, and spoke kindly.</p>

<p>Behind their conveyance came group after group
of people, quite a procession. It looked as if no-one
wanted to be the first to put foot on the rag and bone
man's ground. Where the officials went, they too could
follow, but the auctioneer and his clerk were the only
ones to shake hands with Lars Peter; the others hung
aimlessly about, and put their heads together, keeping
up a whispering conversation.</p>

<p>Lars Peter summed up the buyers. There were one
or two farmers among them, mean old men, who had
come in the hope of getting a bargain. Otherwise they
were nearly all poor people from round about, cottagers
and laborers who were tempted by the chance of buying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
on credit. They took no notice of him, but rubbed up
against the farmers&mdash;and made up to the clerk; they
did not dare to approach the auctioneer.</p>

<p>"Ay, they behave as if I were dirt," thought Lars
Peter. And what were they after all? Most of them
did not even own enough ground to grow a carrot in.
A good thing he owed them nothing! Even the cottagers
from the marsh, whom he had often helped in
their poverty, followed the others' example and looked
down on him today. There was no chance now of
getting anything more out of him.</p>

<p>After all, it was comical to go round watching people
fight over one's goods and chattels. They were not
too grand to take the rag and bone man's leavings&mdash;if
only they could get it on credit and make a good
bargain.</p>

<p>The auctioneer knew most of them by name, and
encouraged them to bid. "Now, Peter Jensen Hegnet,
make a good bid. You haven't bought anything from
me for a whole year!" said he suddenly to one of the
cottagers. Or, "Here's something to take home to
your wife, Jens Petersen!" Each time he named them,
the man he singled out would laugh self-consciously and
make a bid. They felt proud at being known by the
auctioneer.</p>

<p>"Here's a comb, make a bid for it!" shouted the
auctioneer, when the farm implements came to be sold.
A wave of laughter went through the crowd; it was an
old harrow which was put up. The winnowing-machine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
he called a coffee-grinder. He had something funny
to say about everything. At times the jokes were such
that the laughter turned on Lars Peter, and this was
quickly followed up. But Lars Peter shook himself,
and took it as it came. It was the auctioneer's profession
to say funny things&mdash;it all helped on the sale!</p>

<p>The poor silly day laborer, Johansen, was there too.
He stood behind the others, stretching his neck to see
what was going on&mdash;in ragged working clothes and
muddy wooden shoes. Each time the auctioneer made
a remark, he laughed louder than the rest, to show that
he joined in the joke. Lars Peter looked at him
angrily. In his house there was seldom food, except
what others were foolish enough to give him&mdash;his
earnings went in drink. And there he stood, stuck-up
idiot that he was! And bless us, if he didn't make a
bid too&mdash;for Lars Peter's old boots. No-one bid
against him, so they were knocked down to him for a
crown. "You'll pay at once, of course," said the auctioneer.
This time the laugh was against the buyer;
all knew he had no money.</p>

<p>"I'll pay it for him," said Lars Peter, putting the
crown on the table. Johansen glared at him for a
few minutes; then sat down and began putting on the
boots. He had not had leather footwear for years
and years.</p>

<p>Indoors, a table was set out with two large dishes of
sandwiches and a bottle of brandy, with three glasses
round. At one end of the table was a coffee-pot. Ditte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
kept in the kitchen; her cheeks were red with excitement
in case her preparations should not be appreciated.
She had everything ready to cut more sandwiches as
soon as the others gave out; every other minute she
peeped through the door to see what was going on, her
heart in her mouth. Every now and then a stranger
strolled into the room, looking round with curiosity,
but passed out without eating anything. A man entered&mdash;he
was not from the neighborhood, and Ditte did not
know him. He stepped over the bench, took a sandwich,
and poured himself out a glass of brandy. Ditte
could see by his jaws that he was enjoying himself.
Then in came a farmer's wife, drew him away by his
arm, whispering something to him. He got up, spat
the food out into his hand, and followed her out of
doors.</p>

<p>When Lars Peter came into the kitchen, Ditte lay
over the table, crying. He lifted her up. "What's the
matter now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing," sniffed Ditte, struggling to get
away. Perhaps she wanted to spare him, or perhaps
to hide her shame even from him. Only after much
persuasion did he get out of her that it was the food.
"They won't touch it!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>He had noticed it himself.</p>

<p>"Maybe they're not hungry yet," said he, to comfort her.
"And they haven't time either."</p>

<p>"They think it's bad!" she broke out, "made from
dog's meat or something like that."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense!" Lars Peter laughed
strangely. "It's not dinner-time either."</p>

<p>"I heard a woman telling her husband myself&mdash;not
to touch it," she said.</p>

<p>Lars Peter was silent for a few minutes. "Now,
don't worry over it," said he, stroking her hair. "Tomorrow
we're leaving, and then we shan't care a fig for
them. There's a new life ahead of us. Well, I
must go back to the auction; now, be a sensible
girl."</p>

<p>Lars Peter went over to the barn, where the auction
was now being held. At twelve o'clock the auctioneer
stopped. "Now we'll have a rest, good people, and
get something inside us!" he cried. The people
laughed. Lars Peter went up to the auctioneer. Every
one knew what he wanted; they pushed nearer to see
the rag and bone man humiliated. He lifted his dented
old hat, and rubbed his tousled head. "I only wanted
to say"&mdash;his big voice rang to the furthermost corners&mdash;"that
if the auctioneer and his clerk would take us
as we are, there's food and beer indoors&mdash;you are welcome
to a cup of coffee too." People nudged one another&mdash;who
ever heard such impudence&mdash;the rag and
bone man to invite an auctioneer to his table, and his
wife a murderess into the bargain! They looked on
breathlessly; one farmer was even bold enough to warn
him with a wink.</p>

<p>The auctioneer thanked him hesitatingly. "We've
brought something with us, you and your clever little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
girl have quite enough to do," said he in a friendly
manner. Then, noticing Lars Peter's crestfallen appearance,
and the triumphant faces of those around, he
understood that something was going on in which he
was expected to take part. He had been here before&mdash;on
an unpleasant errand&mdash;and would gladly make matters
easier for these honest folk who bore their misfortune
so patiently.</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks very much," said he jovially, "strangers'
food always tastes much nicer than one's own!
And a glass of brandy&mdash;what do you say, Hansen?"
They followed Lars Peter into the house, and sat down
to table.</p>

<p>The people looked after them a little taken aback,
then slunk in one by one. It would be fun to see how
such a great man enjoyed the rag and bone man's
food. And once inside, for very shame's sake they had
to sit down at the table. Appetite is infectious, and
the two of them set to with a will. Perhaps people
did not seriously believe all the tales which they themselves
had both listened to and spread. Ditte's sandwiches
and coffee quickly disappeared, and she was sent
for by the auctioneer, who praised her and patted her
cheeks. This friendly act took away much of her bitterness
of mind, and was a gratifying reward for all her
trouble.</p>

<p>"I've never had a better cup of coffee at any sale,"
said the auctioneer.</p>

<p>When they began again, a stranger had appeared.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
He nodded to the auctioneer, but ignored everybody
else, and went round looking at the buildings and land.
He was dressed like a steward, with high-laced boots.
But any one could see with half an eye that he was no
countryman. It leaked out by degrees that he was a
tradesman from the town, who wished to buy the
Crow's Nest&mdash;probably for the fishing on the lake&mdash;and
use it as a summer residence.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there was little chance of many bids for
the place, but his advent changed the outlook. It
really could be made into a good little property,
once all was put in order. When the Crow's Nest
eventually was put up for sale, there was some competition,
and Lars Peter got a good price for the
place.</p>

<p>At last the auction was over, but the people waited
about, as if expecting something to happen. A stout
farmer's wife went up to Lars Peter and shook his
hand. "I should like to say good-by to you," said she,
"and wish you better luck in your new home than
you've had here. You've not had much of a time,
have you?"</p>

<p>"No, and the little good we've had's no thanks to
any one here," said Lars Peter.</p>

<p>"Folks haven't treated you as they ought to have
done, and I've been no better than the rest, but 'tis our
way. We farmers can't bear the poor. Don't think
too badly of us. Good luck to you!" She said good-by
to all the children with the same wish. Many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
the people made off, but one or two followed her example,
and shook hands with them.</p>

<p>Lars Peter stood looking after them, the children by
his side. "After all, folk are often better than a man
gives them credit for," said he. He was not a little
moved.</p>

<p>They loaded the cart with their possessions, so as to
make an early start the next morning. It was some
distance to the fishing-hamlet, and it was better to get
off in good time, to settle down a little before night.
Then they went to bed; they were tired out after their
long eventful day; they slept on the hay in the barn, as
the bedclothes were packed.</p>

<p>The next morning was a wonderful day to waken up
to. They were dressed when they wakened, and had
only to dip their faces in the water-trough in the yard.
Already they felt a sensation of something new and
pleasant. There was only the coffee to be drunk, and
the cow to be taken to the neighbor's, and they were
ready to get into the cart. Klavs was in the shafts, and
on top of the high load they put the pig, the hens and
the three little ones. It was a wonderful beginning to
the new life.</p>

<p>Lars Peter was the only one who felt sad. He made
an excuse to go over the property again, and stood behind
the barn, gazing over the fields. Here he had
toiled and striven through good and bad; every ditch
was dear to him&mdash;he knew every stone in the fields,
every crack in the walls. What would the future bring?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Lars Peter had begun afresh before, but never with
less inclination than now. His thoughts turned to bygone
days.</p>

<p>The children, on the contrary, thought only of the
future. Ditte had to tell them about the beach, as
she remembered it from her childhood with Granny,
and they promised themselves delightful times in their
new home.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_IX" id="II_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
A Death</span></h2>


<p>The winter was cold and long. Lars Peter had
counted on getting a share in a boat, but there
seemed to be no vacancy, and each time he reminded
the inn-keeper of his promise, he was put off
with talk. "It'll come soon enough," said the inn-keeper,
"just give it time."</p>

<p>Time&mdash;it was easy to say. But here he was waiting,
with his savings dwindling away&mdash;and what was he
really waiting for? That there might be an accident,
so he could fill the place&mdash;it was not a pleasant thought.
It had been arranged that the inn-keeper should help
Lars Peter to get a big boat, and let him manage it;
at least, so Lars Peter had understood before he moved
down to the hamlet. But it had evidently been a great
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>He went about lending a hand here and there, and
replacing any one who was ill. "Just wait a little
longer," said the inn-keeper. "It'll be all right in the
end! You can get what you want at the store." It
was as if he were keeping Lars Peter back for some
purpose of his own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the spring came, heralded by furious storms
and accidents round about the coast. One morning
Lars Jensen's boat came in, having lost its master; a
wave had swept him overboard.</p>

<p>"You'd better go to the inn-keeper at once," said
his two partners to Lars Peter.</p>

<p>"But wouldn't it be more natural to go to Lars
Jensen's widow?" asked Lars Peter. "After all, 'tis
she who owns the share now."</p>

<p>"We don't want to be mixed up in it," said they cautiously.
"Go to whoever you like. But if you've
money in the house, you should put it into the bank&mdash;the
hut might easily catch fire." They looked meaningly
at each other and turned away.</p>

<p>Lars Peter turned this over in his mind&mdash;could that
be the case? He took the two thousand crowns he
had put by from the sale to build with, and went up to
the inn-keeper.</p>

<p>"Will you take care of some money for me?" he
said in a low voice. "You're the savings bank for us
down here, I've been told."</p>

<p>The inn-keeper counted the money, and locked it up
in his desk. "You want a receipt, I suppose?" said
he.</p>

<p>"No-o, it doesn't really matter," Lars Peter said
slowly. He would have liked a written acknowledgment,
but did not like to insist on it. It looked as if he
mistrusted the man.</p>

<p>The inn-keeper drew down the front of the desk&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
sounded to Lars Peter like earth being thrown on a
coffin. "We can call it a deposit on the share in the
boat," said he. "I've been thinking you might take
Lars Jensen's share."</p>

<p>"Oughtn't I to have arranged it with Lars Jensen's
widow, and not with you?" said Lars Peter. "She
owns the share."</p>

<p>The inn-keeper turned towards him. "You seem to
know more about other people's affairs in the hamlet
than I do, it appears to me," said he.</p>

<p>"No, but that's how I understood it to be," mumbled
Lars Peter.</p>

<p>Once outside, he shrugged his shoulders. Curse it,
a fellow was never himself when with that hunch-backed
dwarf. That he had no neck&mdash;and that huge
head! He was supposed to be as strong as a lion,
and there was brain too. He made folk dance to his
piping, and got his own way. There was no getting
the better of <i>him</i>. Just as he thought of something
cutting which would settle him, the inn-keeper's face
would send his thoughts all ways at once. He was not
satisfied with the result of his visit, but was glad to
get out again.</p>

<p>He went down to the beach, and informed the two
partners of what he had done. They had no objection;
they liked the idea of getting Lars Peter as a
third man: he was big and strong, and a good fellow.
"Now, you'll have to settle with the widow," said
they.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>"What, that too?" broke out Lars Peter. "Good
Lord! has the share to be paid for twice?"</p>

<p>"You must see about that yourself," they said; "we
don't want to be mixed up in it!"</p>

<p>He went to see the widow, who lived in a little hut
in the southern part of the hamlet. She sat beside the
fireplace eating peas from a yellow bowl; the tears ran
down her cheeks, dropping into the food. "There's
no-one to earn money for me now," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Ay, and I'm afraid I've put my foot in it," said
Lars Peter, crestfallen. "I've paid the inn-keeper two
thousand crowns for the share of the boat, and now I
hear that it's yours."</p>

<p>"You couldn't help yourself," said she, and looked
kindly at him.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it yours then?"</p>

<p>"My husband took it over from the inn-keeper
about a dozen years ago, and paid for it over and
over again, he said. But it's hard for a poor widow
to say anything, and have to take charity from others.
It's hard to live, Lars Peter! Who'll shelter me now?
and scold me and make it up again?" She began to
cry afresh.</p>

<p>"We'll look you up as often as we can, and as to
food, we'll get over that too. I shouldn't like to be
unfair to any one, and least of all to one who's lost her
bread-winner. Poor folks must keep together."</p>

<p>"I know you won't let me want as long as you have
anything yourself. But you've got your own family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
to provide for, and food doesn't grow on the downs
here. If only it doesn't happen here as it generally does&mdash;that
there's the will but not the means."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay&mdash;one beggar must help the other. You
shan't be forgotten, if all goes well. But you must
spit three times after me when I've gone."</p>

<p>"Ay, that I will," said the widow, "and I wish you
luck."</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>Here was an opportunity for him to work. A little
luck with the catch, and all would be well. He was
glad Lars Jensen's widow wished him no ill in his new
undertaking. The curse of widows and the fatherless
was a heavy burden on a man's work.</p>

<p>Now that Lars Peter was in the hamlet, he found it
not quite what he had imagined it to be; he could easily
think of many a better place to settle down in. The
whole place was poverty-stricken, and no-one seemed to
have any ambition. The fishermen went to sea because
they were obliged to. They seized on any excuse to
stay at home. "We're just as poor whether we work
hard or not," said they.</p>

<p>"Why, what becomes of it all?" asked Lars Peter
at first, laughing incredulously.</p>

<p>"You'll soon see yourself!" they answered, and
after a while he began to understand.</p>

<p>That they went to work unwillingly was not much
to be wondered at. The inn-keeper managed everything.
He arranged it all as he liked. He paid for all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
repairs when necessary, and provided all new implements.
He took care that no-one was hungry or cold,
and set up a store which supplied all that was needed&mdash;on
credit. It was all entered in the books, no doubt, but
none of them ever knew how much he owed. But
they did not care, and went on buying until he stopped
their credit for a time. On the other hand, if anything
were really wrong in one of the huts, he would step in
and help.</p>

<p>That was why they put up with the existing condition
of things, and even seemed to be content&mdash;they
had no responsibilities. When they came ashore with
their catch, the inn-keeper took it over, and gave them
what he thought fit&mdash;just enough for a little pocket-money.
The rest went to pay off their debts&mdash;he said.
He never sent in any bills. "We'd better not go into
that," he would say with a smile, "do what you can."
One and all of them probably owed him money; it
would need a big purse to hold it all.</p>

<p>They did not have much to spend. But then, on the
other hand, they had no expenses. If their implements
broke or were lost at sea, the inn-keeper provided
new ones, and necessaries had only to be fetched from
the store. It was an extraordinary existence, thought
Lars Peter; and yet it appealed to one somehow. It
was hard to provide what was needed when a man was
on his own, and tempting to become a pensioner as it
were, letting others take the whole responsibility.</p>

<p>But it left no room for ambition. It was difficult for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
him to get his partners to do more than was strictly
necessary; what good was it exerting themselves? They
went about half asleep, and with no spirit in their
work. Those who did not spend their time at the inn
drinking and playing cards had other vices; there was
no home life anywhere.</p>

<p>Lars Peter had looked forward to mixing with his
fellow-men, discussing the events of the day, and learning
something new. Many of the fishermen had been
abroad in their young days, on merchant vessels or in
the navy, and there were events happening in other
countries which affected both him and them. But all
their talk was of their neighbors' affairs&mdash;the inn-keeper
always included. He was like a stone wall surrounding
them all. The roof of his house&mdash;a solid
building down by the coast, consisting of inn, farm and
store&mdash;could be seen from afar, and every one involuntarily
glanced at it before anything was said or
done. With him, all discussions ended.</p>

<p>No-one had much good to say for him. All their
earnings went to him in one way or other&mdash;some spent
theirs at the inn, others preferred to take it out in
food&mdash;and all cursed him in secret.</p>

<p>Well, that was their business. In the end, people
are treated according to their wisdom or stupidity.
Lars Peter did not feel inclined to sink to the level of
the others and be treated like a dumb animal. His
business was to see that the children lacked for nothing
and led a decent life.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_X" id="II_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
The New World</span></h2>


<p>Ditte stood in the kitchen, cutting thick slices
of bread and dripping for the three hungry
little ones, who hung in the doorway following
her movements eagerly with their eyes. She
scolded them: it was only an hour since dinner, and
now they behaved as if they had not tasted food for a
week. "Me first, me first!" they shouted, stretching
out their hands. It stopped her washing up, and might
waken her father, who was having a nap up in the
attic&mdash;it was ridiculous. But it was the sea that gave
them such enormous appetites.</p>

<p>The more she hushed them, the more noise they
made, kicking against the door with their bare feet.
They could not wait; as soon as one got a slice of bread,
he made off to the beach to play. They were full of
spirits&mdash;almost too much so indeed. "You mind the
king of the cannibal islands doesn't catch sight of you,"
she shouted after them, putting her head out of the
door, but they neither heard nor saw.</p>

<p>She went outside, and stood gazing after them, as
they tore along, kicking up the sand. Oh dear, Povl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
had dropped his bread and dripping in the sand&mdash;but
he picked it up again and ran on, eating as he went.
"It'll clean him inside," said Ditte, laughing to herself.
They were mad, simply mad&mdash;digging in the sand
and racing about! They had never been like this
before.</p>

<p>She was glad of the change herself. Even if there
had been any opportunity, she could not play; all
desires had died long ago. But there was much of
interest. All these crooked, broken-down moss-grown
huts, clustered together on the downs under the high
cliffs, each surrounded by its dust-heap and fish-refuse
and implements, were to Ditte like so many different
worlds; she would have liked to investigate them all.</p>

<p>It was her nature to take an interest in most things,
though, unlike Kristian, she didn't care to roam about.
He was never still for a moment; he had barely found
out what was behind one hill, before he went on to the
next. He always wanted to see beyond the horizon,
and his father always said, he might travel round the
whole world that way, for the horizon was always
changing. Lars Peter often teased him about this; it
became quite a fairy tale to the restless Kristian, who
wanted to go over the top of every new hill he saw,
until at last he fell down in the hamlet again&mdash;right
down into Ditte's stew-pan. He had often been punished
for his roaming&mdash;but to no good. Povl wanted
to pick everything to pieces, to see what was inside, or
was busy with hammer and nails. He was already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
nearly as clever with his hands as Kristian. Most of
what he made went to pieces, but if a handle came off a
brush, he would quickly mend it again. "He only pulls
things to pieces so as to have something to mend again,"
said his father. Sister stood looking on with her big
eyes.</p>

<p>Ditte was always doing something useful, otherwise
she was not happy. With Granny's death, all her interest
in the far-off had vanished; that there was something
good in store for her she never doubted, it acted
as a star and took away the bitterness of her gloomy
childhood. She was not conscious of what it would
be, but it was always there like a gleam of light. The
good in store for her would surely find her. She stayed
at home; the outside world had no attractions for her.</p>

<p>Her childhood had fallen in places where neighbors
were few and far between. The more enjoyment it was
to her now to have the society of others.</p>

<p>Ditte took a keen interest in her fellow-beings, and
had not been many days in the hamlet before she knew
all about most people's affairs&mdash;how married people
lived together, and who were sweethearts. She could
grasp the situation at a glance&mdash;and see all that lay
behind it; she was quick to put two and two together.
Her dull and toilsome life had developed that sense,
as a reward for all she had gone through. There
was some spite in it too&mdash;a feeling of vengeance against
all who looked down on the rag and bone man, although
they themselves had little to boast about.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>The long, hunch-backed hut, one end of which the
inn-keeper had let off to them, lay almost in the midst
of the hamlet, just above the little bay. Two other
families beside lived in the little hut, so they only had
two small rooms and a kitchen to call their own, and
Lars Peter had to sleep in the attic. It was only a
hovel, "the workhouse" it was generally called, but it
was the only place to be had, and they had to make the
best of it, until Lars Peter could build something himself&mdash;and
they might thank the inn-keeper that they
had a roof above their heads. Ditte was not satisfied
with the hut&mdash;the floors were rotten, and would not
dry when she had washed them. It was no better than
the Crow's Nest&mdash;and there was much less room. She
looked forward to the new house that was to be built.
It should be a real house, with a red roof glistening in
the sun, and an iron sink that would not rot away.</p>

<p>But in spite of this she was quite happy. When she
stood washing up inside the kitchen door, she could see
the downs, and eagerly her eyes followed all who went
to and fro. Her little brain wondered where they were
going, and on what errand. And if she heard voices
through the wall, or from the other end of the hut, she
would stop in her work and listen breathlessly. It was
all so exciting; the other families in the hut were always
bustling and moving about&mdash;the old grandmother, who
lay lame in bed on the other side of the wall, cursing
existence, while the twins screamed at the top of their
voices, and the Lord only knew where the daughter-in-law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
was, and Jacob the fisherman and his daughter in
the other end of the hut. Suddenly, as one stood thinking
of nothing at all, the inn-keeper would come strolling
over the downs, looking like a goblin, to visit the
young wife next door; then the old grandmother
thumped on the floor with her crutch, cursing everything
and everybody.</p>

<p>There was much gossip in the hamlet&mdash;of sorrow
and shame and crime; Ditte could follow the stories herself,
often to the very end. She was quick to find the
thread, even in the most difficult cases.</p>

<p>Her life was much happier now: there was little to
do in the house, and no animals to look after, so she had
more time of her own. Her schooldays were over, and
she was soon to be confirmed. Even the nag, whom at
first she had been able to keep her eye on from the
kitchen window, needed no looking after now. The inn-keeper
had forbidden them to let it feed on the downs,
and had taken it on to his own farm. There it had been
during the winter, and they only saw it when it was
carting sea-weed or bringing a load of fish from the
beach for the inn-keeper. It was not well-treated in its
present home, and had all the hard tasks given it, so as
to spare the inn-keeper's own animals. Tears came
into Ditte's eyes when she thought of it. It became
like a beast of burden in the fairy tale, and no-one there
to defend it. It was long since it had pulled crusts of
bread from her mouth with its soft muzzle.</p>

<p>Ditte lost her habit of stooping, and began to fill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
out as she grew up. She enjoyed the better life and
the children's happiness&mdash;the one with the other added
to her well-being. Her hair had grown, and allowed
itself the luxury of curling over her forehead, and her
chin was soft and round. No-one could say she was
pretty, but her eyes were beautiful&mdash;always on the
alert, watching for something useful to do. Her hands
were red and rough&mdash;she had not yet learned how to
take care of them.</p>

<p>Ditte had finished in the kitchen, and went into the
living room. She sat down on the bench under the
window, and began patching the children's clothes; at
the same time she could see what was happening on the
beach and on the downs.</p>

<p>Down on the shore the children were digging with all
their might, building sand-gardens and forts. To the
right was a small hut, neat and well cared for, outside
which Rasmus Olsen, the fisherman, stood shouting in
through the window. His wife had turned him out&mdash;it
always sounded so funny when he had words with his
wife, he mumbled on loudly and monotonously as a
preacher&mdash;it made one feel quite sleepy. There was
not a scrap of bad temper in him. Most likely his wife
would come out soon, and she would give it him in another
fashion.</p>

<p>They were always quarreling, those two&mdash;and always
about the daughter. Both spoiled her, and each tried
to get her over to their side&mdash;and came to blows over it.
And Martha, the wretch, sided first with one and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
with the other&mdash;whichever paid her best. She was a
pretty girl, slim but strong enough to push a barrow
full of fish or gear through the loose sand on the downs,
but she was wild&mdash;and had plenty to say for herself.
When she had had a sweetheart for a short time, she
always ended by quarreling with him.</p>

<p>The two old people were deaf, and always came outside
to quarrel&mdash;as if they needed air. They themselves
thought they spoke in a low voice, all the time
shouting so loudly that the whole hamlet knew what
the trouble was about.</p>

<p>Ditte could see the sea from the window&mdash;it glittered
beneath the blazing sun, pale blue and wonderful.
It was just like a big being, softly caressing&mdash;and then
suddenly it would flare up! The boats were on the
beach, looking like cattle in their stalls, side by side.
On the bench, two old fishermen sat smoking.</p>

<p>Now all the children from the hamlet came rushing
up from the beach, like a swarm of frightened bees.
They must have caught sight of the inn-keeper! He
did not approve of children playing; they ought to be
doing something useful. They fled as soon as he
appeared, imagining that he had the evil eye. The
swarm spread over the downs in all directions, and
suddenly vanished, as if the earth had swallowed them.</p>

<p>Then he came tramping in his heavy leather boots.
His long arms reached to his knees. When he went
through the loose sand, his great bony hands on his
thighs, he looked as if he were walking on all fours.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
His misshapen body was like a pair of bellows, his head
resting between his broad shoulders, moved up and
down like a buoy; every breath sounded like a steam-whistle,
and could be heard from afar. Heavens,
how ugly he looked! He was like a crouching goblin,
who could make himself as big as he pleased, and see
over all the huts in his search for food. The hard
shut mouth was so big that it could easily swallow a
child's head&mdash;and his eyes! Ditte shut her own, and
shivered.</p>

<p>She quickly opened them, however; she must find out
what his business was, taking care not to be seen herself.</p>

<p>The ogre, as the children called him, mainly because
of his big mouth, came to a standstill at Rasmus Olsen's
house. "Well, are you two quarreling again?" he
shouted jovially. "What's wrong now&mdash;Martha, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>Rasmus Olsen was silent, and shuffled off towards the
beach. But his wife was not afraid, and turned her
wrath on to the inn-keeper. "What's it to do with
you?" she cried. "Mind your own business!" The
inn-keeper passed on without taking any notice of her,
and entered the house. Most likely he wanted to see
Martha; she followed on his heels. "You can save
yourself the trouble, there's nothing for you to pry
into!" she screamed. Shortly afterwards he came out
again, with the woman still scolding at his heels, and
went across the downs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>The fisherman's wife stood looking round, then
catching sight of Ditte, she came over. She had not
finished yet, and needed some object to go on with.
"Here he goes round prying, the beastly hunch-back!"
she screamed, still beside herself with rage, "walking
straight into other people's rooms as if they were his
own. And that doddering old idiot daren't throw him
out, but slinks off. Ay, they're fine men here on the
downs; a woman has to manage it all, the food and the
shame and everything! If only the boy had lived."
And throwing her apron over her head, she began to
cry.</p>

<p>"Was he drowned?" asked Ditte sympathetically.</p>

<p>"I think of it all day long; I shall never forget him;
there'll be no happiness in life for me. Maybe it's
stupid to cry, but I can't help it&mdash;it's the mean way he
met his death. If he had been struck down by illness,
and the Lord had had a finger in it&mdash;'twould be quite
another thing! But that he was strong and well&mdash;'twas
his uncle wanted him to go out shooting wild
duck. I tried to stop him, but the boy <i>would</i> go, and
there was no peace until he did. 'But, Mother,' he
said, 'you know I can handle a gun; why, I shoot every
day.' Then they went out in the boat with two guns,
and not ten minutes afterwards he was back again, lying
dead in a pool of blood. That's why I can't bear to see
wild ducks, or taste 'em either. Whenever I sit by the
window, I can see them bringing him in&mdash;there they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
again. That's why my eyes are dimmed, I'm always
crying: 'tis all over with me now."</p>

<p>The woman was overcome by grief. Her hands
trembled, and moved aimlessly over the table and
back again.</p>

<p>Ditte looked at her from a new point of view.
"Hush, hush, don't cry any more," said she, putting
her arms round her and joining in her tears. "Wait&mdash;I'll
make a cup of coffee." And gradually she succeeded
in comforting her.</p>

<p>"You've good hands," said the old woman, taking
Ditte's hand gratefully. "They're rough and red because
your heart's in the right place."</p>

<p>As they were having their coffee, Lars Peter returned.
He had been to see the inn-keeper, to hear
how the nag was being treated, and was out of humor.
Ditte asked what was troubling him.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's the nag&mdash;they'll finish it soon," said he
miserably.</p>

<p>The fisherman's wife looked at him kindly. "At
least I can hear your voice, even though you're talking
to some one else," said she. "Ay, he's taken your
horse&mdash;and cart too! He can find a use for everything,
honor and money&mdash;and food too! D'you go to
the tap-room?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't been there yet," said Lars Peter,
"and I don't think to go there every day."</p>

<p>"No, that's just it: you're not a drinker, and such
are treated worse than the others. He likes folks to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
spend their money in the tap-room more than in the
store&mdash;that's his way. He wants your money, and
there's no getting out of it."</p>

<p>"How did he come to lord it over the place? It
hasn't always been like this," said Lars Peter.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;because the folk here are no good&mdash;at all
events here in the hamlet. If we've no-one to rule us,
then we run about whining like dogs without a master
until we find some one to kick us. We lick his boots
and choose him for our master, and then we're satisfied.
In my childhood it was quite different here, everybody
owned their own hut. But then he came and got hold
of everything. There was an inn here of course, and
when he found he couldn't get everything his own way,
he started all these new ideas with costly fishing-nets
and better ways and gear, and God knows what. He
gave them new-fangled things&mdash;and grabbed the catch.
The fishermen get much more now, but what's the
good, when he takes it all! I'd like to know what made
you settle down here?"</p>

<p>"Round about it was said that he was so good to
you fisher-people, and as far as I could see there was
no mistake about it either. But it looks rather different
now a man's got into the thing."</p>

<p>"Heavens! <i>good</i>, you say! He helps and helps,
until a man hasn't a shirt left to his back. Just you
wait; you'll be drawn in too&mdash;and the girl as well
if she's pretty enough for him. At present he's only
taking what you've got. Afterwards he'll help you till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
you're so deep in debt that you'd like to hang yourself.
Then he'll talk to you about God and Holy Scripture.
For he can preach too&mdash;like the devil!"</p>

<p>Lars Peter stared hopelessly. "I've heard that he
and his wife hold some kind of meetings, but we've
never been; we don't care much for that sort of thing.
Not that we're unbelievers, but so far we've found it
best to mind our own affairs, and leave the Lord to look
after His."</p>

<p>"We don't go either, but then Rasmus drinks&mdash;ay,
ay, you'll go through it all yourself. And here am I
sitting gossiping instead of getting home." She went
home to get supper ready for the doddering idiot.</p>

<p>They sat silent for a few minutes. Then Ditte said:
"If only we'd gone to some other place!"</p>

<p>"Oh, things are never as black as they're painted!
And I don't feel inclined to leave my money and everything
behind me," answered Lars Peter.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_XI" id="II_CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
Gingerbread House</span></h2>


<p>Now that the children were surrounded by
people, they felt as if they lived in an ant-hill.
The day was full of happenings, all equally
exciting&mdash;and the most exciting of it all was their
fear of the "ogre." Suddenly, when they were playing
hide-and-seek amongst the boats, or sat riding
on the roof of the engine-house, he would appear, his
long arms grasping the air, and if he caught hold of
one of them, they would get something else to add to
their fear. His breath smelt of raw meat, the children
declared; they did not make him out better than he
was. To run away from him, with their hearts thumping,
gave zest to their existence.</p>

<p>And when they lay in bed at night listening, they
heard sounds in the house, which did not come from any
of their people. Then came steps in stocking-feet up
in the attic, and they would look towards Ditte. Kristian
knew what it meant, and they buried their heads
underneath the bedclothes, whispering. It was Jacob,
the fisherman, creeping about upstairs, listening to what
they said. He always stole about, trying to find out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
from the talk a certain <i>word</i> he could use to drive the
devil out of the inn-keeper. The children worried over
the question, because he had promised them sixpence
if they could discover the word. And from the other
side of the wall, they could hear the old grandmother's
cough. She had dropsy, which made her fatter and
fatter outside, but was hollow within. She coughed up
her inside.</p>

<p>The son was on a long voyage, and seldom came
home; but each time he returned, he found one of the
children dead and his wife with a new baby to make
up for it. She neglected her children, and in consequence
they died. "Light come, light go!" said folk,
and laughed. Now only the twins remained: there they
lay in the big wooden cradle, screaming day and night,
with a crust of bread as a comforter. The mother was
never at home. Ditte looked after them, or they
would have perished.</p>

<p>A short distance away on the downs, was a little
house, quite different from the others. It was the most
beautiful house the little ones had ever seen: the door
and the window-panes were painted blue; the beams
were not tarred as in the other huts, but painted brown;
the bricks were red with a blue stripe. The ground
round the house was neat: the sand was raked, and
by the well it was dry and clean. A big elder&mdash;the only
tree in the whole hamlet&mdash;grew beside the well. On
the window-sill were plants, with red and blue flowers,
and behind them sat an old woman peeping out. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
wore a white cap, and the old man had snow-white
hair. When the weather was fine he was always pottering
round the house. And occasionally the old
woman appeared at the door, admiring his handiwork.
"How nice you've made everything look, little
father!" said she. "Ay, it's all for you, little mother,"
he answered, and they laughed at each other. Then he
took hold of her hand, and they tripped towards the
elder tree and sat down in the shade; they were like a
couple of children, but she soon wanted to go back to
her window, and it was said that she had not gone beyond
the well for many a year.</p>

<p>The old people kept to themselves, and did not mix
with the other inhabitants of the hamlet, but when
Lars Peter's children passed, the old woman always
looked out and nodded and smiled. They made some
excuse to pass the house several times a day: there
was something in the pretty little place and the two old
people which attracted them. The same cleanness and
order that ruled their house was apparent in their lives;
no-one in the hamlet had anything but good to say of
them.</p>

<p>Amongst themselves, the children called it Gingerbread
House, and imagined wonderful things inside
it. One day, hand in hand, the three went up and
knocked on the door. The old man opened it. "What
do you want, children?" he asked kindly, but blocking
the door. Yes, what did they want&mdash;none of them
knew. And there they stood open-mouthed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let them come inside, father," a voice said.
"Come in then, children." They entered a room that
smelt of flowers and apples. Everything was painted:
ceiling, beams and walls; it all shone; the floor was
painted white, and the table was so brightly polished
that the window was reflected in it. In a softly cushioned
armchair a cat lay sleeping.</p>

<p>The children were seated underneath the window,
each with a plate of jelly. A waterproof cloth was put
on the table, in case they spilled anything. The old
couple trotted round them anxiously; their eyes gleamed
with pleasure at the unexpected visit, but they were
uneasy about their furniture. They were not accustomed
to children, and Povl nearly frightened their
lives out of them, the way he behaved. He lifted his
plate with his little hands, nearly upsetting its contents,
and said: "Potatoes too!" He thought it was jam.
But sister helped him to finish, and then it was happily
over. Kristian had gulped his share in a couple of
spoonfuls, and stood by the door, ready to run off to
the beach&mdash;already longing for something new. They
were each given a red apple, and shown politely to the
door; the old couple were tired. Povl put his cheek on
the old woman's skirt. "Me likes you!" said he.</p>

<p>"God bless you, little one! Did you hear that,
father?" she said, nodding her withered old head.</p>

<p>Kristian thought he too ought to show his appreciation.
"If you want any errands done, only tell me,"
said he, throwing back his head. "I can run ever so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
fast." And to show how clever he was on his legs,
he rushed down the path. A little way down, he turned
triumphantly. "As quick as that," he shouted.</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks, we'll remember," nodded the two old
people.</p>

<p>This little visit was the introduction to a pleasant
acquaintance. The old people liked the children, and
even fetched them in when passing, and bore patiently
with all their awkwardness. Not that they were allowed
to tumble about&mdash;they could do that on the
downs. The old man would tell them a story, or get his
flute and play to them. The children came home with
sparkling eyes, and quieter than usual, to tell Ditte all
about it.</p>

<p>The following day, Ditte went about pondering how
she could do the old people a service for their kindness
towards the children, and, as she could think of nothing,
she took Kristian into her confidence. He was so clever
in finding ways out of difficulties.</p>

<p>It was the fisher-people's custom to put aside some
of the catch before it was delivered to the inn-keeper,
and one day Ditte took a beautiful thick plaice, and told
Kristian to run with it to the old couple. "But they
mustn't know that it is from us," said she. "They'll
be having their after-dinner nap, so you can easily
leave it without their seeing you." Kristian put it down
on the little bench underneath the elder; but when later
on he crept past, to see if it had been taken, only the
tail and the fins remained&mdash;the cat had eaten it up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Ditte scolded him well, and Kristian had to puzzle his
brains once more.</p>

<p>"Father might get Klavs, and take them for a drive
on Sunday," said he. "They never get anywhere&mdash;their
legs are too old."</p>

<p>"You silly!&mdash;we've nothing to do with Klavs now,"
Ditte said sharply.</p>

<p>But now she knew what to do! She would scrub out
the <i>little house</i> for them every night; the old woman
had to kneel down to do it every morning. It was a
sin she should have to do it. After the old people had
gone to bed&mdash;they went to rest early&mdash;Ditte took a pail
of water and a scrubbing brush, and some sand in her
pinafore, and crept up. Kristian stood outside at home,
waiting for her. He was not allowed to go with her,
for fear of disturbing the old couple&mdash;he was so
noisy.</p>

<p>"What d'you think they'll say when they come down
in the morning and find it all so clean?" cried he,
hopping first <a class="corr" name="TC_9" id="TC_9" title="one">on</a> one foot and then the other. He
would have liked to stay up all night to see their
surprise.</p>

<p>Next time the children visited the old people, the old
man told them a story about a little fairy who came
every night to scour and scrub, to save his little mother.
Then Kristian laughed&mdash;he knew better.</p>

<p>"It was Ditte!" he burst out. He put his hand to
his mouth next moment, but it was too late.</p>

<p>"But Ditte isn't a fairy!" broke out sister Else,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
offended. They all three laughed at her until she began
to cry, and had to be comforted with a cake.</p>

<p>On their way home, whom should they meet but
Uncle Johannes, who was looking for their house. He
was rigged out very smartly, and looked like a well-to-do
tradesman. Lars Peter was pleased to see him.
They had not met since their unfortunate parting in the
Crow's Nest, and now all was forgotten. He had
heard one or two things about him&mdash;Johannes kept the
gossips busy. The two brothers shook hands as if no
unpleasantness had come between them. "Sit down
and have something to eat," said Lars Peter. "There's
boiled cod today."</p>

<p>"Thanks, but I'm feeding up at the inn later on;
we're a few tradesmen up there together."</p>

<p>"That'll be a grand dinner, I suppose?" Lars
Peter's eyes shone; he had never been to a dinner party
himself.</p>

<p>"Ay, that it will&mdash;they do things pretty well up
there. He's a good sort, the inn-keeper."</p>

<p>"Some think so; others don't. It all depends how
you look at him. You'd better not tell them you're
my brother&mdash;it'll do you no good to have poor relations
down here."</p>

<p>Johannes laughed: "I've told the inn-keeper&mdash;he
spoke well of you. You were his best fisherman, he
said."</p>

<p>"Really, did he say that?" Lars Peter flushed
with pride.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>"But a bit close, he said. You thought codfish
could talk reason."</p>

<p>"Well, now&mdash;what the devil did he mean by it?
What nonsense! Of course codfish can't speak!"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But he's a clever man&mdash;he might
have been one of the learned sort."</p>

<p>"You're getting on well, I hear," said Lars Peter,
to change the subject. "Is it true you're half engaged
to a farmer's daughter?"</p>

<p>Johannes smiled, stroking his woman-like mouth,
where a small mustache was visible. "There's a deal
of gossip about," was all he said.</p>

<p>"If only you keep her&mdash;and don't have the same bad
luck that I had. I had a sweetheart who was a farmer's
daughter, but she died before we were married."</p>

<p>"Is that true, Father?" broke out Ditte, proud of
her father's standing.</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>"What do you think of him, my girl?" asked Lars
Peter, when his brother had gone. "Picked up a bit,
hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Ay, he looks grand," admitted Ditte. "But I
don't like him all the same."</p>

<p>"You're so hard to please." Lars Peter was offended.
"Other folks seem to like him. He'll marry
well."</p>

<p>"Ay, that may be. It's because he's got black hair&mdash;we
women are mad on that. But I don't think he's
good."</p>

Daily Troubles</span></h2>


<p>It was getting on towards Christmas, a couple of
months after they had come to the hamlet, when
one day Lars Peter was mad enough to quarrel
with the inn-keeper. He was not even drunk and it
was a thing unheard of in the hamlet for a sober man
to give the inn-keeper a piece of his mind. But he had
been more than stupid, every one agreed, and he himself
too.</p>

<p>It was over the nag. Lars Peter could not get used
to seeing the horse work for others, and it cut him to
the heart that it should have to work so hard. It
angered him, too, to be idle himself, in spite of the
inn-keeper's promises&mdash;and there were many other
things besides. One day he declared that Klavs
should come home, and he would begin to drive round
again. He went up to the farm and demanded his
horse.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" The inn-keeper followed him out and
ordered the horse to be harnessed. "Here's your
horse, cart and everything belonging to it&mdash;is there anything
more of yours?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Lars Peter was somewhat taken aback. He had expected
opposition and here was the inn-keeper quite
friendly, in fact almost fawning on him. "I wanted
to cart some things home," said he, rather crestfallen.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Lars Peter Hansen," said the inn-keeper,
preceding him into the shop. He weighed out all Lars
Peter ordered, reminded him of one thing after another,
laying the articles in a heap on the counter.
"Have you raisins for the Christmas cakes?" he asked.
"Ditte bakes herself." He knew every one's doings
and was thoughtful in helping them.</p>

<p>When Lars Peter was about to carry the things out
to the cart, he said smilingly, "That will be&mdash;let me
see, how much do you owe for last time?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to let it wait a bit&mdash;till I get settled up
after the auction!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid it can't. I don't know anything
about you yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you're paying me out." Lars Peter began
to fume.</p>

<p>"Paying you out? Not at all. But I like to know
what sort of a man I'm dealing with before I can trust
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! It's easy enough to see what sort of
a fellow you are!" shouted Lars Peter and rushed out.</p>

<p>The inn-keeper followed him out to the cart.
"You'll have a different opinion of me some day," said
he gently, "then we can talk it over again. Never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
mind. But another thing&mdash;where'll you get food for
the horse?"</p>

<p>"I'll manage somehow," answered Lars Peter
shortly.</p>

<p>"And stabling? It's setting in cold now."</p>

<p>"You leave that to me!"</p>

<p>Lars Peter drove off at a walking pace. He knew
perfectly well that he could find neither food nor stabling
for the horse without the inn-keeper's help. Two
or three days afterwards he sent Kristian with the
horse and cart back to the farm.</p>

<p>He had done this once, but he was wiser now&mdash;or at
all events more careful. When occasionally he felt a
longing for the road and wanted to spend a day on it
in company with Klavs, he asked politely for the loan
of it, and he was allowed to have it. Then he and the
horse were like sweethearts who seldom saw each
other.</p>

<p>He was no wiser than before. The inn-keeper he
couldn't make out&mdash;with his care for others and his
desire to rule.</p>

<p>His partners and the other men he didn't understand
either. He had spent his life in the country where
people kept to themselves&mdash;where he had often longed
for society. It looked cosy&mdash;as seen from the lonely
Crow's Nest&mdash;people lived next door to each other;
they could give a helping hand occasionally and chat
with each other. But what pleasure had a man here?
They toiled unwillingly, pushing responsibilities and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
troubles on to others, getting only enough for a meager
meal from day to day and letting another man run off
with their profits. It was extraordinary how that
crooked devil scraped in everything with his long arms,
without any one daring to protest. He must have an
enormous hold on them somehow.</p>

<p>Lars Peter did not think of rebelling again. When
his anger rose he had only to think of fisher-Jacob,
who was daily before his eyes. Every one knew how
he had become the wreck he was. He had once owned
a big boat, and had hired men to work with him, so he
thought it unnecessary to submit to the inn-keeper.
But the inn-keeper licked him into shape. He refused
to buy his fish, so that they had to sail elsewhere with
it, but this outlet he closed for them too. They could
buy no goods nor gear in the village&mdash;they were
shunned like lepers, no one dared help them. Then his
partners turned against him, blaming him for their
ill-luck. He tried to sell up and moved to another
place, but the inn-keeper would not buy his possessions
and no-one else dared; he had to stay on&mdash;and learn to
submit. Although he owned a boat and gear, he had to
hire it from the inn-keeper. It told so heavily on him
that he lost his reason; now he muddled about looking
for a magic word to fell the inn-keeper; at times he
went round with a gun, declaring he would shoot him.
But the inn-keeper only laughed.</p>

<p>Ditte talked a great deal with the women. They all
agreed that the inn-keeper had the evil eye. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
always in her mind; she went in an everlasting dread
of him. When she saw him on the downs she almost
screamed; Lars Peter tried to reason her out
of it.</p>

<p>Little Povl came home from the beach one morning
feeling ill. He was sick, and his head ached, he was
hot one moment and cold the next. Ditte undressed
him and put him to bed; then called her father, who
was asleep in the attic.</p>

<p>Lars Peter hurried down. He had been out at sea
the whole night and stumbled as he walked.</p>

<p>"Why, Povl, little man, got a tummy-ache?" asked
he, putting his hand on the boy's forehead. It
throbbed, and was burning hot. The boy turned his
head away.</p>

<p>"He looks really bad," he said, seating himself on
the edge of the bed, "he doesn't even know us. It's
come on quickly, there was nothing the matter with
him this morning."</p>

<p>"He came home a few minutes ago&mdash;he was all
gray in the face and cold, and he's burning hot now.
Just listen to the way he's breathing."</p>

<p>They sat by the bedside, looking at him in silence;
Lars Peter held his little hand in his. It was black,
with short stumpy fingers, the nails almost worn down
into the flesh. He never spared himself, the little
fellow, always ready; wide awake from the moment
he opened his eyes. Here he lay, gasping. It was a
sad sight! Was it serious? Was there to be trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
with the children again? The accident with his first
children he had shaken off&mdash;but he had none to spare
now! If anything happened to them, he had nothing
more to live for&mdash;it would be the end. He understood
now that they had kept him up&mdash;through the business
with Sörine and all that followed. It was the children
who gave him strength for each new day. All his
broken hopes, all his failures, were dimmed in the
cheery presence of the children; that was perhaps why
he clung to them, as he did.</p>

<p>Suddenly Povl jumped up and wanted to get out of
bed. "Povl do an' play, do an' play!" he said over
and over again.</p>

<p>"He wants to go out and play," said Ditte, looking
questioningly at her father.</p>

<p>"Then maybe he's better already," broke out Lars
Peter cheerily. "Let him go if he wants to."</p>

<p>Ditte dressed him, but he drooped like a withered
flower, and she put him to bed again.</p>

<p>"Shall I fetch Lars Jensen's widow?" she asked.
"She knows about illness and what to do."</p>

<p>No&mdash;Lars Peter thought not. He would rather
have a proper doctor. "As soon as Kristian comes
home from school, he can run up to the inn, and ask for
the loan of the nag," said he. "They can hardly refuse
it when the child's ill."</p>

<p>Kristian came back without the horse and cart, but
with the inn-keeper at his heels. He came in without
knocking at the door, as was his custom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hear your little boy's ill," he said kindly. "I
thought I ought to come and see you, and perhaps give
you a word of comfort. I've brought a <a class="corr" name="TC_10" id="TC_10" title="botttle">bottle</a> of something
to give him every half hour; it's mixed with
prayers, so at all events it can't do him any harm.
Keep him well wrapped up in bed." He leaned over
the bed, listening to the child's breathing. Povl's eyes
were stiff with fear.</p>

<p>"You'd better keep away from the bed," said Lars
Peter. "Can't you see the boy's afraid of you?" His
voice trembled with restrained fury.</p>

<p>"There's many that way," answered the inn-keeper
good-naturedly, moving away from the bed. "And
yet I live on, and thrive&mdash;and do my duty as far as I
can. Well, I comfort myself with the thought that
the Lord has some reward in store. Perhaps it does
folks no harm to be afraid of something, Lars Peter!
But give him the mixture at once."</p>

<p>"I'd rather fetch the doctor," said Lars Peter, reluctantly
giving the child the medicine. He would have
preferred to throw it out of the window&mdash;and the inn-keeper
with it.</p>

<p>"Ay, so I understood, but I thought I'd just have
a talk to you first. What good's a doctor? It's only
an expense, and he can't change God's purpose. Poor
people should learn to save."</p>

<p>"Ay, of course, when a man's poor he must take
things as they come!" Lars Peter laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"Up at the inn we never send for the doctor. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
put our lives in God's keeping. If so be it's His will,
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It seems to me there's much that happens that's
not His will at all&mdash;and in this place too," said Lars
Peter defiantly.</p>

<p>"And yet I'll tell you that not even the smallest
cod is caught&mdash;in the hamlet either&mdash;without the will
of the Father." The inn-keeper's voice was earnest;
it sounded like Scripture itself, but there was a look in
his eyes, which made Lars Peter uncomfortable all the
same. He was quite relieved when this unpleasant
guest took his departure and disappeared over the
downs.</p>

<p>Ditte came down from the attic, where she had hidden.
"What d'you want to hide from that hunch-back
for?" shouted Lars Peter. He needed an outlet for
his temper. Ditte flushed and turned away her face.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a knock sounded on the wall. It
was their lame neighbor. The daughter-in-law was at
home, and sat with the twins in her arms.</p>

<p>"I heard he was in your house," said the old one&mdash;"his
strong voice sounded through the walls. You be
careful of him!"</p>

<p>"He was very kind," said Ditte evasively. "He
spoke kindly to father, and brought something for little
Povl."</p>

<p>"So he brought something&mdash;was it medicine? Pour
it into the gutter at once. It can't do any harm there."</p>

<p>"But Povl's had some."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>The old woman threw up her hands. "For the love
of Jesus! for the love of Jesus! Poor child!" she
wailed. "Did he say anything about death? They say
in the village here every family owes him a death!
Did he say he'd provide the coffin? He manages everything&mdash;he's
always so good and helpful when anything's wrong. Ay,
maybe he was good-tempered&mdash;and the child'll be allowed to live."</p>

<p>Ditte burst into tears; she thought it looked bad for
little Povl, if his life depended on the inn-keeper. He
was vexed with them because the little ones were not
sent to Sunday-school&mdash;perhaps he was taking his revenge.</p>

<p>But in a few days Povl recovered, and was as lively
as ever, running about and never still for a minute,
until suddenly he would fall asleep in the midst of his
play. Lars Peter was cheerful again, and went about
humming. Ditte sang at her washing up, following the
little lad's movements with her motherly eyes. But
for safety's sake she sent the children to Sunday-school.</p>

<h2><span class="caps smaller"><a name="II_CHAPTER_XIII" id="II_CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
Ditte's Confirmation</span></h2>


<p>That autumn Ditte was to be confirmed. She
found it very hard to learn by rote all the
psalms and hymns. She had not much time for
preparation, and her little brain had been trained
in an entirely different direction than that of learning
by heart; when she had finished her work, and
brought out her catechism, it refused to stay in her
mind.</p>

<p>One day she came home crying. The parson had
declared that she was too far behind the others and
must wait for the next confirmation; he dared not take
the responsibility of presenting her. She was in the
depths of despair; it was considered a disgrace to be
kept back.</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;there's no end of our troubles, it seems,"
broke out Lars Peter bitterly. "They can do what
they like with folks like us. I suppose we should be
thankful for being allowed to live."</p>

<p>"I know just as much as the others, it's not fair,"
sobbed Ditte.</p>

<p>"Fair&mdash;as if that had anything to do with it! If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
you did not know a line of your catechism, I'd like to
see the girl that's better prepared to meet the Lord
than you. You could easily take his housekeeping on
your shoulders; and He would be pretty blind if He
couldn't see that His little angels could never be better
looked after. The fact is we haven't given the parson
enough, they're like that&mdash;all of them&mdash;and it's the
likes of them that have the keys of Heaven! Well, it
can't be helped, it won't kill us, I suppose."</p>

<p>Ditte refused to be comforted. "I <i>will</i> be confirmed,"
she cried. "I won't go to another class and
be jeered at."</p>

<p>"Maybe if we tried oiling the parson a little," Lars
Peter said thoughtfully. "But it'll cost a lot of
money."</p>

<p>"Go to the inn-keeper then&mdash;he can make it all
right."</p>

<p>"Ay, that he can&mdash;there's not much he can't put
right, if he's the mind to. But I'm not in his good
books, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter. He treats every one alike
whether he likes them or not."</p>

<p>Lars Peter did not like his errand; he was loth to
ask favors of the man; however, it must be done for the
sake of the child. Much to his surprise the inn-keeper
received him kindly. "I'll certainly speak to the parson
and have it seen to," said he. "And you can send
the girl up here some day; it's the custom in the hamlet
for <i>the ogre's</i> wife to provide clothes for girls going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
be confirmed." His big mouth widened in a grin.
Lars Peter felt rather foolish.</p>

<p>So Ditte was confirmed after all. For a whole week
she wore a long black dress, and her hair in a thin
plait down her back. In the church she had cried;
whether it was the joy of feeling grown-up, or because
it was the custom to cry, would be difficult to say. But
she enjoyed the following week, when Lars Jensen's
widow came and did her work, while she made calls
and received congratulations. She was followed by a
crowd of admiring girls, and small children of the
hamlet rushed out to her shouting: "Hi, give us a ha'penny!"
Lars Peter had to give all the halfpennies he could
gather together.</p>

<p>The week over, she returned to her old duties. Ditte
discovered that she had been grown-up for several
years; her duties were neither heavier nor lighter. She
soon got accustomed to her new estate; when they were
invited out, she would take her knitting with her and sit
herself with the grown-ups.</p>

<p>"Won't you go with the young people?" Lars Peter
would say. "They're playing on the green tonight."
She went, but soon returned.</p>

<p>Lars Peter was getting used to things in the hamlet;
at least he only grumbled when he had been to the tap-room
and was a little drunk. He no longer looked after
the house so well; when Ditte was short of anything
she had always to ask for it&mdash;and often more
than once. It was not the old Lars Peter of the Crow's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Nest, who used to say, "Well, how goes it, Ditte, got
all you want?" Having credit at the store had made
him careless. When Ditte reproached him, he answered:
"Well, what the devil, a man never sees
a farthing now, and must take things as they
come!"</p>

<p>The extraordinary thing about the inn-keeper was,
that he seemed to know everything. As long as Lars
Peter had a penny left, the inn-keeper was unwilling
to give him credit, and made him pay up what he owed
before starting a new account. In this way he had
stripped him of one hundred-crown note after the other,
until by Christmas nothing was left.</p>

<p>"There!" said Lars Peter when the last note went,
"that's the last of the Crow's Nest. Maybe now
we'll have peace! And he can treat us like the others
in the hamlet&mdash;or I don't know where the food's to
come from."</p>

<p>But the inn-keeper thought differently. However
often the children came in with basket and list, they
returned empty-handed. "He seems to think
there's still something to get out of us," said Lars
Peter.</p>

<p>It was a sad lookout. <a class="corr" name="TC_11" id="TC_11" title="Dite">Ditte</a> had promised herself
that they should have a really good time this
Christmas; she had ordered flour, and things for cakes,
and a piece of pork to be stuffed and cooked like a
goose. Here she was empty-handed; all her beautiful
plans had come to nothing. Up in the attic was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Christmas tree which the little ones had taken from
the plantation; what good was it now, without candles
and ornaments?</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Lars Peter, "we'll get over that
too. We've got fish and potatoes, so we shan't
starve!" But the little ones cried.</p>

<p>Ditte made the best of a bad job, and went down to
the beach, where she got a pair of wild ducks that had
been caught in the nets: she cleaned and dressed them&mdash;and
thus their Christmas dinner was provided. A
few red apples&mdash;which from time to time had been
given her by the old couple at the Gingerbread House,
and which she had not eaten because they were so
beautiful&mdash;were put on the Christmas tree. "We'll
hang the lantern on the top, and then it'll look quite
fine," she explained to the little ones. She had borrowed
some coffee and some brandy&mdash;her father should
not be without his Christmas drink.</p>

<p>She had scrubbed and cleaned the whole day, to
make everything look as nice as possible; now she went
into the kitchen and lit the fire. Lars Peter and the
children were in the living room in the dusk&mdash;she could
hear her father telling stories of when he was a boy.
Ditte hummed, feeling pleased with everything.</p>

<p>Suddenly she screamed. The upper half of the
kitchen door had opened. Against the evening sky
she saw the head and shoulders of a deformed body,
a goblin, in the act of lifting a parcel in over the door.
"Here's a few things for you," he said, panting, pushing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the parcel along the kitchen-table. "A happy
Christmas!" And he was gone.</p>

<p>They unpacked the parcel in the living room. It
contained everything they had asked for, and many
other things beside, which they had often wished for
but had never dreamt of ordering: a calendar with
stories, a pound of cooking chocolate, and a bottle of
old French wine. "It's just like the Lord," said Ditte
in whose mind there were still the remains of the
parson's teaching&mdash;"when it looks blackest He always
helps."</p>

<p>"Ah, the inn-keeper's a funny fellow, there we've
been begging for things and got nothing but kicks in
return; and then he brings everything himself! He's
up to something, I'm afraid. Well, whatever it may
be&mdash;the things'll taste none the worse for it!" Lars
Peter was not in the least touched by the gift.</p>

<p>Whatever it might be&mdash;at all events it did not end
with Christmas. They continued to get goods from
the store. The inn-keeper often crossed off things from
the list, which he considered superfluous, but the children
never returned with an empty basket. Ditte still
thought she saw the hand of Providence in this, but
Lars Peter viewed it more soberly.</p>

<p>"The devil, he can't let us starve to death, when
we're working for him," said he. "You'll see the
rascal's found out that there's nothing more to be got
out of us, he's a sharp nose, he has."</p>

<p>The explanation was not entirely satisfactory&mdash;even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
to Lars Peter himself. There was something about the
inn-keeper which could not be reckoned as money. He
was anxious to rule, and did not spare himself in any
way. He was always up and doing; he had every
family's affairs in his head, knew them better than they
did themselves, and interfered. There was both good
and bad in his knowledge; no-one knew when to expect
him.</p>

<p>Lars Peter was to feel his fatherly care in a new
direction. One day the inn-keeper said casually:
"that's a big girl, you've got there, Lars Peter; she
ought to be able to pay for her keep soon."</p>

<p>"She's earned her bread for many a year, and
more too!" answered Lars Peter. "I don't know
what I'd have done without her."</p>

<p>The inn-keeper went on his way, but another time
when Lars Peter was outside chopping wood he came
again and began where he left off. "I don't like to see
children hanging about after they've been confirmed,"
said he. "The sooner they get out the quicker they
learn to look after themselves."</p>

<p>"Poor people learn that soon enough whether they
are at home or out at service," answered Lars Peter.
"We couldn't do without our little housekeeper."</p>

<p>"They'd like to have Ditte at the hill-farm next
May&mdash;it's a good place. I've been thinking Lars Jensen's
widow could come and keep house for you; she's
a good worker and she's nothing to do. You might do
worse than marry her."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've a wife that's good enough for me," answered
Lars Peter shortly.</p>

<p>"But she's in prison&mdash;and you're not obliged to stick
to her if you don't want to."</p>

<p>"Ay, I've heard that, but Sörine'll want somewhere
to go when she comes out."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a matter for your own conscience, Lars
Peter. But the Scriptures say nothing about sharing
your home with a murderess. What I wanted to
say was, that Lars Jensen's wife takes up a whole
house."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps we could move down to her?" said
Lars Peter brightly. "It's not very pleasant living here
in the long run." He had given up all hope of building
himself.</p>

<p>"If you marry her, you can consider the house your
own."</p>

<p>"I'll stick to Sörine, I tell you," shouted Lars
Peter, thumping his ax into the block. "Now, you
know it."</p>

<p>The inn-keeper went off, as quietly and kindly as he
had come. Jacob the fisherman stood behind the house
pointing at him with his gun; it was loaded with salt,
he was only waiting for the <i>word</i> to shoot. The inn-keeper
looked at him as he passed and said, "Well, are
you out with your gun today?" Jacob shuffled out of
the way.</p>

<p>The inn-keeper's new order brought sorrow to the
little house. It was like losing a mother. What would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
they do without their house-wife, Ditte, who looked
after them all?</p>

<p>Ditte herself took it more quietly. She had always
known that sooner or later she would have to go out
to service&mdash;she was born to it. And all through her
childhood it ran like a crimson thread; she must prepare
herself for a future master and mistress. "Eat,
child," Granny had said, "and grow big and strong and
able to make the most of yourself when you're out
amongst strangers!" And Sörine&mdash;when her turn came&mdash;had
made it a daily saying: "You'd better behave, or
no-one'll have you." The schoolmaster had interwoven
it with his teachings, and the parson involuntarily
turned to her when speaking of faithful service. She
had performed her daily tasks with the object of becoming
a clever servant&mdash;and she thought with a mixture
of fear and expectation of the great moment when
she should enter service in reality.</p>

<p>The time was drawing near. She was sorry, and
more so for those at home. For herself&mdash;it was something
that could not be helped.</p>

<p>She prepared everything as far as possible beforehand,
taught sister Else her work, and showed her
where everything was kept. She was a thoughtful
child, easily managed. It was more difficult with Kristian.
Ditte was troubled at the thought of what would
happen, when she was not there to keep him in order.
Every day she spoke seriously to him.</p>

<p>"You'll have to give up your foolish ways, and running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
off when you're vexed with any one," said she.
"Remember, you're the eldest; it'll be your fault if
Povl and sister turn out badly! They've nobody but
you to look to now. And stop teasing old Jacob, it's
a shame to do it."</p>

<p>Kristian promised everything&mdash;he had the best will
in the world. Only he could never remember to keep
his good resolutions.</p>

<p>There was no need to give Povl advice, he was too
small. And good enough as he was. Dear, fat, little
fellow! It was strange to think that she was going to
leave him; several times during the day Ditte would
hug him.</p>

<p>"If only Lars Jensen's widow'll be good to the children&mdash;and
understand how to manage them!" she said
to her father. "You see, she's never had children of
her own. It must be strange after all!"</p>

<p>Lars Peter laughed.</p>

<p>"It'll be all right," he thought, "she's a good
woman. But we shall miss you sorely."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you will," answered Ditte seriously.
"But she's not wasteful&mdash;that's one good thing."</p>

<p>In the evening, when she had done her daily tasks
and the children were in bed, Ditte went through
drawers and cupboards so as to leave everything in
order for her successor. The children's clothes were
carefully examined&mdash;and the linen; clean paper was
put in the drawers and everything tidied up. Ditte
lingered over her work: it was like a silent devotion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
The child was bidding farewell to her dear troublesome
world, feeling grateful even for the toil and trouble
they had given her.</p>

<p>When Lars Peter was not out fishing she would sit
beside him under the lamp with some work or other
in her hands, and they spoke seriously about the future,
giving each other good advice.</p>

<p>"When you get amongst strangers you must listen
carefully to everything that's said to you," Lars Peter
would say. "Nothing vexes folks more than having to
say a thing twice. And then you must remember that
it doesn't matter so much how you do a thing, as to do
it as they like it. They've all got their own ways, and
it's hard to get into sometimes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll get on all right," answered Ditte&mdash;rather
more bravely than she really felt.</p>

<p>"Ay, you're clever enough for your age, but it's not
always that. You must always show a good-tempered
face&mdash;whether you feel it or not. It's what's expected
from folks that earn their bread."</p>

<p>"If anything happens, I'll just give them a piece of
my mind."</p>

<p>"Ay, but don't be too ready with your mouth! The
truth's not always wanted, and least of all from a servant:
the less they have to say the better they get on.
Just you keep quiet and think what you like&mdash;that no-one
can forbid you. And then you know, you've always
got a home here if you're turned out of your place.
You must never leave before your term is up; it's a bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
thing to do&mdash;whatever you do it for. Rather bear a
little unfairness."</p>

<p>"But can't I stand up for my rights?" Ditte did
not understand.</p>

<p>"Ay, so you ought&mdash;but what is your right? Anyone
that's got the power gets the right on his side,
that's often proved. But you'll be all right if you're
sensible and put your back to the wall."</p>

<hr class="w45" />

<p>Then came the last night. Ditte had spent the day
saying good-by in the different huts. She could have
found a better way to spend these last precious hours,
but it was a necessary evil, and if she did not do it they
would talk of it behind her back. The three little ones
followed close at her heels.</p>

<p>"You mustn't come in," said she. "We can't all go,
there's too many, they'll think we want to be treated
to something."</p>

<p>So they hid themselves nearby, while she was inside,
and went with her to the next house; today they <i>would</i>
be near her. And they had been so the whole day
long. The walk along the beach out to the Naze, where
they could see the hill-farm had come to nothing. It
was too late, and Ditte had to retract her promise.
It cost some tears. The farm where Ditte was going
out to service played a strong part in their imagination.
They were only comforted, when their father promised
that on Sunday morning he would take them for a row.</p>

<p>"Out there you can see the hill-farm and all the land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
round about it, and maybe Ditte'll be standing there and
waving to us," he said.</p>

<p>"Isn't it really further off than that?" asked Ditte.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's about fourteen miles, so of course you'd
have to have good eyes," answered Lars Peter, trying
to smile. He was not in the humor for fun.</p>

<p>Now at last the three little ones were in the big bed,
sleeping peacefully, Povl at one end, sister and Kristian
at the other. There was just room for Ditte, who
had promised to sleep with them the last night. Ditte
busied herself in the living room, Lars Peter sat by the
window trying to read Sörine's last letter. It was only
a few words. Sörine was not good at writing; he read
and re-read it, in a half-whisper. There was a feeling
of oppression in the room.</p>

<p>"When's Mother coming out?" asked Ditte, suddenly
coming towards him.</p>

<p>Lars Peter took up a calendar. "As far as I can
make out, there's still another year," he said quietly.
"D'you want to see her too?"</p>

<p>Ditte made no answer. Shortly afterwards she
asked him: "D'you think she's altered?"</p>

<p>"You're thinking of the little ones, I suppose. I
think she cares a little more for them now. Want
makes a good teacher. You must go to bed now, you'll
have to be up early in the morning, and it's a long way.
Let Kristian go with you&mdash;and let him carry your
bundle as far as he goes. It'll be a tiresome way for
you. I'm sorry I can't go with you!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be all right," said Ditte, trying to speak
cheerfully, but her voice broke, and suddenly she threw
her arms round him.</p>

<p>Lars Peter stayed beside her until she had fallen
asleep, then went up to bed himself. From the attic he
could hear her softly moaning in her sleep.</p>

<p>At midnight he came downstairs again, he was in
oilskins and carried a lantern. The light shone on the
bed&mdash;all four were asleep. But Ditte was tossing restlessly,
fighting with something in her dreams. "Sister
must eat her dinner," she moaned, "it'll never do
... she'll get so thin."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said Lars Peter with emotion. "Father'll
see she gets enough to eat."</p>

<p>Carefully he covered them up, and went down to the
sea.</p>
